Before the auction, the value of the painting was estimated between £400,000 and £600,000.[8] It belonged to the Galerie Judin[9] of Berlin, who had purchased it from the artist.

On the other hand, I do not refrain from resorting to all kinds of idioms, such as the surrealist principle of association or the abstract experiments which foreground texture and surface.' One of the most celebrated painters of his generation, Adrian Ghenie's dynamic work combines his personal memories with collective trauma, both past and present. He draws upon the profoundly personal and the art historical, as well as a sense of national identity, in works which bridge the abstract and figurative. His paintings engage not only with the history of painting, but with 'painting the texture of history' and often include the personalities whose actions have defined its course, whether heroes or villains. Investigating the possibilities of his medium is always central to Ghenie's practice and, by fusing the grand themes and narratives of historical painting with contemporary forms, his works become less about their specific subject-matter and more about the act of painting itself. The artist's expressive handling of paint is heightened by cinematic lighting and compositions influenced by the films of Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch. He draws upon personal memories, art historical references, film stills and images culled from the internet, which are cut out and fused to form the fabric of his paintings. Ghenie's working process involves creating collaged compositions, which he then transfers to canvas with a palette knife to create gestural strokes and textures. The deconstructed images often contain references to his artistic predecessors, including Théodore Géricault, Henri Rousseau and, in his hybrid self-portraits, Vincent van Gogh.\n Read more Download CV.\nOne of the most celebrated painters of his generation, Adrian Ghenie's dynamic work combines his personal memories with collective trauma, both past and present.

Born in 1977 in Baia Mare, Romania, Ghenie lives and works in Berlin. He was selected to represent Romania at the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015 and, more recently, had solo exhibitions in 2019 at the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg and the Palazzo Cini, Venice. The artist has created several installations conceived as a 'room within a room' – The Dada Room (2010), now in the permanent collection of S.M.A.K. Ghent, and The Darwin Room (2013–14), in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, Paris. His previous solo exhibitions include shows at The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg (2019); Palazzo Cini, Venice (2019); Villa Medici, Rome (2017); CAC Málaga, Spain (2014); Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver (2012); Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Ghent (2010); and the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Bucharest (2009). He has also participated in exhibitions at the Centre Pompidou, Paris (2016); Fondation Vincent van Gogh, Arles (2016); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2012); Palazzo Grassi (2011); and Tate Liverpool (2008), among others.

Based in Berlin, the Romanian artist paints portraits: small close-ups of men’s heads and large landscapes, each populated by a solitary individual. In terms of subject matter, Ghenie’s paintings are all about alienation and the angst that accompanies it.

{"id": 5, "data": "Art market news.\nHow Adrian Ghenie conquered the art market The Romanian painter’s prices have increased 160-fold over the past decade. But who, or what, is behind this steep rise? Judd Tully 22 June 2018 Share Adrian Ghenie, Nickelodeon, 2008 (in two parts) © Adrian Ghenie. Photo: Katrin Hammer Sachfotografie, Berlin/ The story of the contemporary painter Adrian Ghenie’s rise from art student in Cluj, Romania, to darling of international curators and auction houses over the course of barely a dozen years is not unprecedented: the art world loves to anoint young talent. It also likes to discard it, but Ghenie, with prodigious skill and the help of many hands along the way, has emerged as a more durable star, one whose work is now, for better or worse, seen as a desirable asset. Ghenie, born in 1977 in Baia Mare, grapples with haunting and historical subjects. His alternately lush and vigorous style has earned him comparisons to Francis Bacon, although Ghenie says: “Despite people[‘s] belief Bacon was never a direct source of inspiration for me....At this point in my career, I do what I always did—I steal from everybody”. Meanwhile, his critical and commercial ascent has been speedy enough to attract attention, without tipping into overexposure. Asked to explain Ghenie’s appeal, the UK independent curator Jane Neal says: “Adrian is an extremely talented painter and manages to engender the feeling of something rather than explicitly outlining exactly what it is. He’s adept at drawing from the past—be it key figures or events from history—but while doing this he simultaneously catapults his work and his canvases into the future by inventing something entirely new. It is never formulaic and always evolving.” Neal’s 2006 group exhibition Cluj Connection—organised at the now-closed Haunch of Venison gallery in Zurich and centred on young painters from the city—was Ghenie’s stepping stone to a solo show, Shadow of a Daydream, at the gallery the following year. He racked up gallery exhibitions in short order, including a solo at the Tim Van Laere Gallery in Antwerp in 2008 and his first London outing, Darkness for an Hour, at Haunch of Venison in 2009. It was from this show that Christie’s (and Haunch of Venison) owner François Pinault, an early fan, bought the virtuoso two-part canvas Nickelodeon (2008) for approximately €60,000. In October 2016, the auction house sold Nickelodeon for an artist-record £7.1m (est. £1m-£1.5m), a price rise of 16,000%, triggering headlines for Ghenie and reaping a big payday for Pinault. Can I buy it? For those involved since the early days, Ghenie’s success comes as no surprise. Juerg Judin, the director of Haunch of Venison at that time who now shows the artist in his home base of Berlin, recalls Ghenie’s first solo show in Zurich. “People came to the opening, but nobody had ever heard his name and it was sold out in 20 minutes. People asked, ‘Who is this and can I buy it?’” “He has an intellectual approach like a conceptual artist in what he’s doing and what he’s trying to tell,” Judin adds, “[but] he’s 100% a painter in the old-fashioned sense.” The curator Gary Garrels first encountered Ghenie’s hybrid, cinematic style in a solo exhibition organised by dealer Mihai Nicodim at Chung King Project in Los Angeles in early 2007. “The paintings were small, very dark and brooding, and beautifully painted,” Garrels says. “They stood out for me from the get-go.” A few years later, Garrels, now the senior curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), was deeply impressed by The Trial (2010), a large-scale canvas depicting the 1989 proceedings against the fallen Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, which led to their immediate execution by firing squad. Ghenie and Nicodim offered to donate the work to SFMOMA, where it is now part of the permanent collection. “I was thrilled,” Garrels says. “We have a significant work by Gerhard Richter, so there is a context for Adrian in the collection.” He adds: “Unfortunately, it’s not possible for us to continue building his work into our collection now. It’s totally out of range for a museum.” Installation shot of Adrian Ghenie’s exhibition “Jungles in Paris\" Charles Duprat/Courtesy of Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac Indeed, desire for Ghenie’s work has fuelled a breakneck rise in the market. Ben Tufnell, a former Tate curator and Haunch of Venison exhibitions director, describes the speed at which Ghenie’s market matured. “In that very first group show,” Tufnell says, “his paintings were something like €2,500 to €4,000, and I kick myself every day that I didn’t buy one.” By the time of Ghenie’s first show in London in 2009, “prices were something like £25,000 and already there was a waiting list. It was starting to become a problem to manage expectations.” Collectors soon turned to the secondary market. Alex Branczik, the head of contemporary art for Sotheby’s Europe, recalls Ghenie’s evening sale debut in February 2013, when a visceral portrait of the Nazi physician, Dr. Mengele 2 (2011), sold for £121,250 against an estimate of £30,000 to £40,000. “Typically,” he says, “we’d do that when we know that there are serious collectors interested and when demand outstrips supply.” A year later, Sotheby’s sold The Fake Rothko (2010) for £1.4m (est £250,000-£350,000), and then Ghenie’s take on Van Gogh and degenerate art, The Sunflowers in 1937 (2014), in February 2016 for £3.1m (est £400,000-£600,000). Branczik adds: “The people who are bidding and buying are some of the world’s top collectors; that’s what sustained it.” As his commercial buzz was building, Ghenie was also expanding his institutional CV, including the solo exhibition Pie-Fights and Pathos at the Contemporary Art Museum, Denver, in 2012-13, at the CAC Malaga in 2014-15 and the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015, where his Darwin’s Room was presented in the Romanian Pavilion. Sources say a “major” museum show is soon to be announced. The flurry of activity might have seemed organic, but “there was a lot of teamwork involved”, Nicodim says. “It didn’t just happen.” He is referring in part to his own efforts and those of Judin and others, such as Rodica Seward, the Romanian-born owner and chief executive of the Paris auction house Tajan, in promoting Ghenie well before mega-galleries, such as Pace and Thaddaeus Ropac, entered the picture, even bringing Ghenie to their attention. Seward also arranged the Centre Pompidou’s early acquisition of Ghenie’s Pie Fight Interior II. Pace took Ghenie on in 2011 and Ropac in 2015. Remarkably, however, Ghenie has remained loyal to his early dealers through this climb, including Galeria Plan B in Cluj, which he co-founded with Mihai Pop in 2005. Can Ghenie’s low output survive the clamour? Thaddaeus Ropac is currently hosting Adrian Ghenie: Jungles in Paris (until 16 June), featuring new paintings based entirely on the works of Henri Rousseau, whom Ghenie regards as the first abstract painter. The works, which are priced from €750,000 to €1.1m for the bigger paintings, €150,000 to €200,000 for drawings, and studies for around €100,000, sold out immediately. Supply and demand “You don’t make friends with a show like this when there’s so much demand,” Ropac says. “It’s not easy for us because we have major collectors wanting the works. He paints very slowly and we only have five big paintings in the exhibition, which also makes the thing more complicated. I always tell my clients he’s a young artist and we will make sure our trusted collectors will get the work. We’re here for the long run.” Adrian Ghenie, The Fake Rothko, 2010 Photo by the artist/© Adrian Ghenie Marc Glimcher, the president of Pace Gallery, who expects to stage another solo show with the artist in two years’ time in either Hong Kong or New York, says: “To hit that level of popularity and power is a huge challenge for someone who is just 40 and has to stand in front of the empty canvas knowing that the world is paying ridiculously large sums of money at auction for them. Adrian’s response was to continue to experiment… and that is something that makes people feel like we will still be looking at this guy in 50 years.” As Glimcher sees it: “Haunch of Venison didn’t do some miraculous marketing job and neither did we. It’s really the paintings. That’s why he is where he is.” Adrian Ghenie in Rome, 2017 Alessandra d'Urso Adrian Ghenie on his fast-forward career In a rare email exchange, Ghenie mused on the double-edged sword of his success. He writes: I think that every young or mid-career artist is a case open to debate (from an artistic point of view). They are judged as work-in-progress artistic phenomena, and as long as their prices are low the conversation around them can be well-balanced. But when an artist like that scores millions at auction, a balanced debate is compromised. People start to be hysterical, over-confident or hyper-skeptical, highly subjective, jealous, etc. This is my case entirely. If you ask me what I wish for the future, I would say that I would like to go back to a sort of normality, but it is hard to define that normality… I don’t really have many colleagues of my age to ask ‘how did you survive this tsunami?’ Charting a carefully calibrated rise 2001 Ghenie graduates from the Art and Design University of Cluj-Napoca. 2006 First show, at Galeria Plan B, Berlin, which Ghenie co-founded with Mihai Pop.

Catalogues, history books, stills from films or images from archives and databases on the internet are the various sources from which the artist draws his models, which are subsequently assembled and juxtaposed. One of his most distinctive traits is the modified representation of celebrated figures of great dictatorships of the 20th century. These figures are recovered only to be denied, through the pictorial elaboration, the historical authority they have acquired in the collective imagination. He takes as a model, for example, photographs of Adolf Hitler and his companion Eva Braun in the summer residence of Berghof, images of Doctor Josef Mengele or the father of the atomic bomb Julius Robert Oppenheimer. The artist cancels the features of the faces and focuses our attention on the appearance of the interiors in which the figures are located, pursuing a strategy of “visual subtraction” that often renders the original images almost unrecognizable. In the work The Devil (2010) the interiors represented refer to a common repertoire of images of bourgeois interiors, with elements like the sofa, wallpaper or clothes that call to mind collective memories of environments typical of past generations. The calm tranquillity of intimate private places is destroyed as soon as we become aware of the subjects represented: the estranging familiarity of ordinary places generates ideas and impulses with enormous destructive potential. Often Ghenie’s works involve a direct clash between what appears on the surface and an implicit meaning when the visual dimension is accompanied by a knowledge of the subject. As the artist himself says, the images documenting our past are often lacking in clarity and materialness due to techniques of visual reproduction like the drawing or the photograph that produce a flat, two-dimensional picture. Apart from some emblematic exceptions, like Self Portrait as a Monkey (2011), Ghenie excludes the possibility of an opening of the pictorial space towards an imaginative field outside the work, working particularly on two main elements: the subject’s gaze, which is often concealed, and the background, which never opens to a further view. In the Pie Fights series Ghenie takes as his subject stills from silent films of the 1920s, based on the use of stereotyped comical scenes such as slipping on a banana skin or a fight that begins or finishes with a custard pie in the face. The stills taken as a model are those in which the actor’s face is covered in the pie custard and is no longer recognizable, the culmination of the ridiculing of the person who in the films invariably removes the custard from his eyes and gazes at the camera, arousing the pity and at the same time the hilarity of the viewer. The decontextualization from the narrative flow of the original film transforms the meaning of the image from a light comic moment to the stigmatization of these figures as victims of an aggression, emphasizing their desperate loss of power and dignity. The face, the element that most distinguishes and identifies a person, melts, leaving the individual anonymous in a gesture of silent alienation. This tension emerges through polarities like abstract and figurative expression, the subtraction and additional of pictorial material, cultured references and popular elements. Ghenie’s pictorial virtuosity in realism is overcome apparently in a destructive act, arriving at a paradoxical “denied expression” directed at the creation of allegories of inner states, metaphors of fading certainties.  BIOGRAPHY Adrian Ghenie (1977, Baia-Mare, Romania; lives and works between Cluj and Berlin), creates materially rich paintings that re-elaborate motifs and figures of the collective imagination. Graduating in 2003 at the Cluj University of Art and Design, in 2005 he was co-founder, together with Mihai Pop, of the Plan B Gallery, a venue entirely dedicated to contemporary art which became the epicentre of the artistic tendencies and research of Cluj. His works are characterized by a combination of the artist’s personal memories and elements and themes drawn from the most heterogeneous sources such as books, films and archives. His works can be found in the public collections of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Hammer Museum, both in Los Angeles, as well as in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA). Works by the artist are also present in Belgium, in the collections of the S.M.A.K. in Ghent and at the Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst Antwerpen (MuHKA) in Antwerp. In the summer of 2009 Hatje Cantz Verlag published the first complete monograph on Adrian Ghenie. Ghenie has held several monographic and collective exhibitions at an international level. Noteworthy among his personal shows are the exhibition of 2006 at the Mihai Nicodim Gallery in Los Angeles, the one held at the Haunch of Venison in Zurich in 2007, the exhibition at the Tim Van Laere Gallery in Antwerp, Belgium (2008), as well as those in 2009 at the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Bucharest, Romania, or at the Haunch of Venison in London. In 2010 personal shows were also held at the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst in Ghent (S.M.A.K.) and, again, at the Mihai Nicodim Gallery in Los Angeles, while in 2011 he staged monographic exhibitions at the Haunch of Venison in London and at the Tim Van Laere Gallery in Antwerp. A big solo show, the first one in an American museum, is planned for the autumn 2012 at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, Colorado. His collective exhibitions include: (2006) Drive Slowly Through Our Land, Mihai Nicodim Gallery, Los Angeles; (2006) Cluj Connection, Haunch of Venison, Zurich; (2007) Galerie Rüdiger Schöttle, Munich; (2007) Expanded Painting 2, Prague Biennale 3; (2008) Liverpool Biennale; Days Become Nights, Galerie Hussenot, Paris; (2009) Drawings and Other Works on Paper, Tim Van Laere Gallery, Antwerp; Expanded Painting 3 – Staging the Grey, Prague Biennale 4; The Punishment of Lust and Luxury, Mihai Nicodim Gallery, Los Angeles; I Watered a Horseshoe as if It Were a Flower, Mihai Nicodim Gallery, Los Angeles; (2011) Communism Never Happened, Charim Galerie, Vienna; The World Belongs to You, Palazzo Grassi – Francois Pinault Foundation, Venice; Just Another Brick in the Wall, Barbara Seiler Galerie, Zurich; (2012) European Travellers, Mücsarnok Kunsthalle, Budapest. .\nEDUCARE AL PRESENTE A look at contemporary culture through the artistic languages. more.\nCONTACTS Information: +39 26

{"id": 8, "data": "Ocula Advisory Advisory Perspectives Curated Selections Advisory Picks About Services Close.\nAdvisory Perspective Juerg Judin\non Adrian Ghenie By Rory Mitchell.\n| Berlin, 13 May 2021.\nArtist Profile Adrian Ghenie View Bio, Works & Exhibitions.\nJuerg Judin met celebrated Romanian painter Adrian Ghenie in 2006, giving him his second solo exhibition and familiarising collectors with his work in Zurich, where his Berlin gallery was previously based. With Ghenie's latest exhibition at Galerie Judin now on view (We Had Everything Before Us, 1 May–10 July 2021), the gallerist reflects on 15 years of collaboration with the artist. You opened your gallery in 2003 and had an exhibition of Adrian Ghenie's paintings in 2007. Could you tell me how this came about? When did you first meet each other or when did you first come across his work?  Adrian Ghenie, Feeling Odd (2021). Oil on canvas. 210 × 170 cm. © The artist. Courtesy Galerie Judin, Berlin.\n I first met Adrian in his hometown of Cluj, Romania, in the fall of 2006. I was working on a group show of young Romanian artists—the now legendary Cluj Connection. My gallery was still in Zurich back then, and I was just about to join forces with Haunch of Venison. I had managed to meet all the eight artists chosen for that show, except for Adrian. He was very reclusive and didn't like travelling. So when I heard that he was going to have a little exhibition in Cluj, I decided to make the trip and meet him on his own turf. There were only six or seven small paintings, and I acquired my first Ghenie. I still have and cherish it. Everything about Adi was mysterious but very intriguing. So I spontaneously offered him a solo show for the following year. It was to be his second ever, and his first outside Cluj. Ghenie was extremely popular with collectors from the outset, but did you ever imagine that things would develop so quickly for him? Every exhibition we did in the 15 years since sold out immediately. The largest painting in the 2007 show could be had for EUR 8,000. Zurich collectors walked into the gallery at the preview and, having never heard of this young Romanian before, asked, 'Can I buy this?'   Adrian Ghenie, Home Alone (2021). Oil on canvas. 210 × 210 cm. © The artist. Courtesy Galerie Judin, Berlin.\n His work has developed a great deal over the last four or five years and seems to reveal even more of his ability to handle paint. How do you view the progression of his painting since 2008? Did I anticipate him becoming one of the most successful artists of his generation and his paintings selling for millions at evening sales? No! But from our discussions about art history—which remains our favourite topic—and recognising his technical brilliance, I was sure he was not a flash in the pan. I have enjoyed the privilege of documenting his development since 2007 as editor and co-author of the three Hatje Cantz monographs.  Adrian Ghenie, The Three Graces (2021). Oil on canvas. 210 × 180 cm. © The artist. Courtesy Galerie Judin, Berlin.\n About 200 of his best paintings are reproduced, and flicking through the pages, you realise that an incredibly intelligent but equally courageous painter has steadily intensified his goal of achieving great narratives with ever more abstraction. He has not once rested on his laurels and has resisted trusting a 'formula', like many artists do once they have reached this level of success. Adi is very skeptical about the art market, his own achievements, and success; and that skepticism is one of his main assets. How does Ghenie work in the studio? Does he work on several paintings at the same time? How long does it tend to take him to make a major painting? Believe it or not: Adrian to this day works without any assistants! He's the archetypal 'lone wolf' painter, who stares at his blank canvases for hours—preferably deep into the night. He doesn't like people watching him at work—me included. But I can answer two of your questions: yes, he works on several paintings at a time. And it is no secret that he thinks about future paintings and prepares their genesis with the help of elaborate collages.   Adrian Ghenie, The Squat (2021). Oil on canvas. 200 × 297 cm. © The artist. Courtesy Galerie Judin, Berlin.\n Do you ever discuss ideas or concepts for exhibitions or even specific paintings with him? Certainly not in any detail. Typically, we meet for lunch at my place. I cook and then we talk about art until dinner time. Mostly, we do virtual tours through our favourite museum collections. No other person I know has as many Old Master paintings recorded in their memory as Adi. At some point, a few weeks before the opening of a show, he'll invite me to the studio. It's always a bit of a shock to see an entire new series of paintings. They are never what you expect. —[O] Main image: Adrian Ghenie, The Squat (2021) (detail).

{"id": 10, "data": "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions Sustainable Cities and Communities.\nConfronting Traumatic Histories in Adrian Ghenie’s Dark and Brooding Paintings by Laurel Mcleod.\n5 months ago 4 min read.\nMidnight blues that turn into slate greys set the scene for a visually demanding composition depicting a figure retching in front of a crimson Rothko painting. The figure has been likened to that of the artist, who is reflecting on the impossible task of creating truly original works. With an enticing yet ghoulish colour scheme, “The Fake Rothko” is Adrian Ghenie’s most famous painting. This 2010 oil on canvas work is nothing short of impressive, both in size and skill. As wide as it is tall, this six-and-a-half-foot painting is nearly imposing. What captivates viewers is its many layers of meaning. Here, Ghenie grapples with issues of appropriation and authenticity while exploring personal and historical narratives in his allusion to the story of Saint Anthony of Egypt. Adrian Ghenie, “The Fake Rothko.” 2010. Image courtesy of Sothebys .\n It is easy to like Ghenie’s work, but it can be difficult to explain why. Perhaps because as much as one is drawn into his paintings, they are equally as repelled. For paintings that are as dynamic and expressive as his, it is fascinating how ominous the works come across in full view. Adrian Ghenie, “The Impressionists.” 2020. Image courtesy of Ocula .\n Working on a large scale, the blend of abstraction and realism gives way to deeply unnerving, psychological paintings. He is known for delving into historical subjects and grappling with eerie matters, specifically focusing on violent European history. Viewers are drawn into the paintings for their expert paint handling but are simultaneously repelled due to the brutality that is exposed. Themes of oppression, persecution, and misery, all involving their own loaded histories, are unveiled. Adrian Ghenie, “Burning Books.” 2014. Image courtesy of Invaluable .\n There is a certain finesse that these paintings possess in terms of illuminating those in history who have abused power and the effects this causes on the abused. Looking at Berlin Zoo we are reminded of the devastating impact of the Iron Curtain. In relation to this abuse of power, we think of Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, the 16th United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. While sharing and drawing attention to these traumatic histories part of totalitarian political systems, Ghenie concurrently advocates for a more peaceful society and justice for all. Adrian Ghenie, “Berlin Zoo.” 2009. Image courtesy of Nicodim Gallery .\n While his work is constantly evolving, he retains his cinematic style, routinely creating brooding paintings of macabre scenes and defaced figures as seen in The Picnic 2 and The Arrival. Of these defaced figures, Ghenie remarks, “the eyes don’t recognise the figure but the brain knows it is there.” The painter has evidently learned how to deconstruct the image, allowing the viewer to do the work of deciphering the forms before them. In this way, his works can be described as bridging the figurative and the abstract. Adrian Ghenie, “The Picnic 2.” 2017. Image courtesy of Ocula ; Adrian Ghenie, “The Arrival.” 2014. Image courtesy of Sothebys .\n To create his works, Ghenie uses a palette knife and stencils that yield scraped planes of colour, and thick layers of impasto made with deft strokes. The more time spent looking at one of his works, the more one focuses on the act of painting that went into it and the potential this medium affords. Adrian Ghenie, “Pie fight study.” 2012. Image courtesy of the artist’s Instagram .\n As a Romanian painter born in 1977 in Baia Mare, Romania, Ghenie has relatively quickly gained recognition as one of his generation’s most celebrated painters. After graduating in 2001 from the University of Art and Design in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, he went on to co-found the exhibition space, Galleria Plan B, and represented Romania at the 2015 Venice Biennale. He now lives and works in Berlin, where he continues to critique abuses of power and confront traumatic histories with his art.

Wikipedia article References.\nAdrian Ghenie (born 13 August 1977, Baia Mare) is a contemporary Romanian painter. The son of a dentist, he studied fine arts at the Arts and Crafts School in Baia Mare between 1991 and 1994. He is a graduate of the Art and Design University of Cluj-Napoca (2001). Ghenie lives and works in Cluj, Berlin, and London. In 2005, he co-founded Galeria Plan B in Cluj, together with Mihai Pop, a production and exhibition space for contemporary art. In 2008 Plan B opened a permanent exhibition space in Berlin. His work has been widely exhibited in group and solo exhibitions, including at Tate Liverpool, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. In June 2014 the oil on canvas painting \"The Fake Rothko\" was sold for £1,426,000 ($2,428,140). In February 2016, the large oil on canvas painting \"The Sunflowers of 1937\" inspired by Vincent van Gogh's famous \"Sunflowers\" was sold in London for £3,177,000 at a Sotheby's auction, marking it the most expensive painting sold by the Romanian artist. Before the auction, the value of the painting was estimated between £400,000 and £600,000 . It belonged to the Galerie Judin of Berlin, who had purchased it from the artist. Ghenie’s work is represented in numerous major museum and public collections including the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Ghent. Ghenie does not use traditional tools of the painter or brushes, but a palette knife and stencils. He paints portraits of 20th century figures, particularly those associated with genocide and mass suffering, that appear in his work gnawed and slashed, blurred and speckled. His painterly style has been compared to that of Francis Bacon. [1] This is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Adrian Ghenie is representing Romania at the Venice Art Biennale (May 9th – November 22nd, 2015) with his project, Darwin's Room (curator: Mihai Pop). We talked on a February afternoon in his Berlin studio, about failure and success, about textures and faces, about fear and fiction. You were born in Baia Mare, in 1977. Did you have the typical childhood of a painter? Did you get colouring pencils for your birthday and then start drawing frantically? Not really. As Baia Mare was quite rural, lots of houses with gardens, hills nearby, it was more like a typical Tom Sawyer childhood. Lots of fighting, gangs, wandering the hills, stealing tomatoes, things like that, nothing special. My folks had nothing to do with painting. They wanted me to be a doctor, like my dad, and painting for them was just something you hung on a wall. And nothing more. We didn't have any books on art at home, I went to local art school of course, because there wasn't anywhere else to go. I spent my summers in Constanța, at my aunt's, who lived in a nationalised house, which had belonged to a former Greek shipping magnate, an amazing art-deco house, destroyed by generations of tenants. You just can't imagine how much texture it had and what a fabulous house it was, a mix between Toate pînzele sus! and Grand Budapest Hotel, split up into all sorts of doors and little rooms, where all these people forced in by the communists during the 1950s were living, strange old bags, old whatshername, that drunk, a defrocked priest, such vivid colours… Do you know what's changed since the Eighties? Not just in Romania, everywhere. Textures have been replaced. A superficial, easy-clean world has appeared, mountains of laminate, polystyrene, double-glazing, plastic, we now use spray-on, ready-to-go things. Romania of the 1980s was a hard-to-clean world of textures, it gathered dust. If I go and visit Constanța now, they've replaced everything, they've taken out the old windows and put in double-glazing, they've replaced the old floors which saw 4 or 5 generations with laminated flooring… This changing of texture in the world has led to a change in our behaviour too, the way we look, our hairstyles. We have a different texture now too. And if we're talking about this... They made me change the windows here, against my wishes. I rent this place, I don't own it. I'll have to change the windows because the owner has decided to replace them all in the whole building. And you know what's strange? These new ones are much more efficient, long-lasting, and yet, emotionally, you like the old ones better. In a way, Romania back then was much more humane, texture-wise, it had its imperfections, it had its mistakes. I'm not referring to the political structure. Compare that plank of wood with this window here. You just can't help yourself. We live on a spaceship. I'm really not the type who says, \"In my day...\", but you can't help not suffer, it's obvious you start feeling nostalgic because that was your childhood. Just recently I saw a video of a TVR1 show covering the elections, sometime during the ’90s, with Rațiu, Cîmpeanu, Iliescu. The armchairs were made of velvet, there was a carpet, a vase with flowers, plants… Now take a look at a modern studio: human silhouettes cut out on a digital thingy, you don't even know what texture that space has. Everything's at the mercy of a socket. If the socket blows, then the background is gone too.\n Getting back to the world you grew up in, you were saying that there weren't any art albums. How did you find out that painting was the best way of expressing yourself? That's a whole chapter on its own: Auntie Rodica. She was a family friend who, besides being nice, was interested in art. She had art albums, had been to Leningrad, had albuns of Repin and Aivazovsky. She noticed that I was talented, she said, 'Look at this kid, he can draw!' and she used to draw with me. Or she would make time to come over to ours for a bit of art criticism, she'd bring her albums with her. She was a chemist, so nothing to do with art either. But she had a way of putting things and of giving you the feeling that what you were doing was really important. My mum would say: 'What's that child doing, has he done his homework?' but she would say, 'Leave him alone, woman, he's drawing!' Somehow, it became a kind of addiction, whatever I did, calling her up to say I was coming over to show her what I'd done. I've recently made it up to Auntie Rodica. I did a piece, Pie Fight, which is in fact her head, and now it's hanging at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. What did you draw when you were a kid? There were three categories. Freestyle, they were kind of a disaster. Then copies of all the kitsch paintings at home. And then Auntie Rodica brought me her albums which I made copies from. And you know, there are some details you just couldn't make up. If I'd tell a westerner, they'd think it was worse than Kafka, even. And I mean I'm talking about '92, not '86. One day, I remember that I'd been given an album and I wanted to paint a copy and realised I couldn't do it using aquarelle, I didn't know why exactly, but I just had a feeling that it wouldn't turn out right. So I was tempted to go and buy some oil paints. I'd been mixing up my dad's old door paint, and I'd caught the bug. I'd noticed that you got a different result if you painted with your finger… And I said to myself that I needed some colours so I went to the Fondul Plastic paint shop. Just imagine, I was a 14 year-old teenager in his own world of painting, and the lady there, a really nice woman and taking my side, told me that she could only sell me paint if I were a member of the National Union of Fine Artists, due to the situation of the company then. And because of that, the only colour she could sell me was violet. And a couple more shitty colours, something like burnt umber, which were useless to me. But my neighbor below us, whose husband had been a big shot in the secret service during communism, was the Director of Fondul Plastic. And so, with friends in the right places, I got hold of white. White was the unicorn, the Holy Grail of Fondul Plastic. After a whole series of friends in right places, I managed to put together a reduced, but basic, palette of colours.\n You were 12 when the Revolution happened. How was it for you? Did you understand the world was changing? I was in the seventh grade. We lived in Baia Mare on a street where a lot of secret police guys lived, a good area, so to say. And they didn't talk much, those secret police guys. My dad was away in his own world most of the time, he'd spend the whole day in the garage, most likely depressed. My mum, on the other hand, had no clue about politics. She'd been in Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring of '68, during their invasion, but she was really happy, thinking it was some kind of military parade. She was one-of-a-kind, a starfish. She didn't understand, she didn't see. It was exactly this kind of perception of hers, amnesia after 8 minutes, which fascinated me when I began painting stuff related to history. I would ask her what it was like, she'd travelled through Poland and Yugoslavia… I loved how she used to tell stories about that world, without using any kind of political filter. It was like her brain just couldn't translate what it meant. As if someone'd tell you about Hitler's Germany without mentioning the Nazis. On the evening of December 21st, I remember we got a phone call from a relative in Cluj telling us that tanks had entered the city. There was a kind of excitement, as if something was happening, I'd heard about Timișoara, I'd tried tuning into the Hungarian channel, but there was just fuzz, but I saw some tanks through the fuzz. The next day, on December 22nd, we woke up and took the sausages to be smoked, that was our priority. I heard a rumour about something to do with Milea, but I had no clear understanding of who those people were exactly. At one moment, I was in the kitchen, my mum said to turn on the TV quickly, and I turned onto Caramitru, after that it was clear what was happening. My brother's 14 years older than me, he was an engineer then, and building a bridge over some river, somewhere in Maramureș, and I was worried. 'Where's my brother, does he know about this?'  My brother showed up about 3 or 4 in the afternoon with a truck full of silver fir trees. That was his moment of being a revolutionary, he'd raided the party tree nursery and cut down the silver firs. I was happy when they shot Ceaușescu. I can't say I'm sorry, not even now. At one moment I went to my room for about 10 minutes and had an ecstatic thought of being able to eat pineapple now. Huge amounts of pineapple. The disappearance of that bastard was associated with a huge amount of pineapple which would appear in my life the next day. Strangely for me, the Revolution is associated, Dada-like, with exotic fruits and the impression of being able to go to places where they grow. Frustration followed though, because there were another 15 years of being handcuffed.\n Let's jump to you graduating from university. What were you doing from 2001 to 2005, when the famous Plan B opened? Did you already have a \"career\" as a painter? At university, I was as anachronistic as the time and place I came from, I was interested in a kind of mystical symbolism which had brought me some success, locally. When I left uni, I didn't know much. A strange period followed, in the sense that I didn't know where to begin. I lived with my mum, I didn't have an income, we both lived off her pension. I painted a whole load of kitsch stuff for 50 Dollars or Deutschmarks, I bet people will turn up with them now to auctions. I still had friends at uni, living in halls of residence, and I used to hang out there, watching videos, playing computer games, Star Wars, that kind of thing. I had a makeshift workshop made out of planks, in my gran's garden. You still needed visas to get out of the country, but where would you go? I'd go to Budapest whenever I made 100 Euros, from one day to the next, so I could get to visit a museum now and then, but I still ended up at the classics, I wasn't really with it. In 2002, I managed to emigrate to Austria. So like each and every Romanian, I thought, \"Great, this is it!\" And there, the feeling that I didn't understand anything just grew stronger. And so, about 6 months after arriving in Austria, I gave up painting. I told myself I'd do what everyone else did, learn the language, get a resident's permit, and find a job. In Austria I was pretending. I tried to reinvent myself, wandering around Vienna, learning German, but I didn't even manage to learn that properly in the end, I just didn't have the patience. I did some paintings, but only as a quick sell, on special order: some guy's mountain hut, that kind of thing. But there was one place I really loved, the MuseumsQuartier, which had an amazing bookstore and good coffee. I spent a lot of time there, relaxing, looking at everything on display, and, at one point, something matured within me. In 2004, I didn't even have enough money to stay in Vienna any more, it was a really shitty situation, so I went to Sicily for a while. In the end, I came back to Romania, like a kind of strategic return. I already had a visa, so I could go back to Vienna whenever I wanted. During that period, Victor Man and Șerban Savu also came back. We'd been classmates, tutorial partners in fact. Șerban had won a scholarship to Academia di Venezia, Victor had moved to Israel. When I came back to Romania, they were also trying to come back too, also after a series of failures.\n So then came Plan B… Yes. At one point I met one of my brother's friends, Mircea Pinte, who's an art-collector now. He had a simple problem to solve : he'd just replastered his new house, and the plasterer had brought him about 25 paintings from Ando, the company that makes you identikit abstract paintings. Mircea said to me 'Why don't you help me pick something out, because I don't know how ?' So I went to his place, and I said, 'Mircea, this is a pile of shit, but I can help you though. You can either choose some of these and you've sorted your problem, or you can begin a collection, which might take a bit of time, you'll need a bit of guidance,  and after about a year or two, you'll have something good hanging here, and it won't be Ando.'  Mircea agreed and asked how he should pay me and I told him I'd like to open a kind of gallery. I went to talk to Mihai Pop about it, who had been taking care of Galeria Academiei and already had experience, and Mihai said : 'OK!' In September 2005, we opened Plan B with a Victor Man exhibition. We called up everyone we knew, just like you do for a wedding. Jane Neal came too, the art journalist who wrote for different magazines. She wrote us a review for Art in America. For our first Plan B exhibition, can you imagine that?!… We were the first Romanian gallery at that time to have had such an important review. More exhibitions followed during that year. We put in the hours, we snoozed in chairs, we turned on the old tiled terracotta stove. A gallery requires you to be flexible, one artist wants mirrors on the ceiling, another wants I don't know what… If I couldn't make a living anymore, then I'd be able to do it as a carpenter, I could renovate your flat. All the exhibitions which followed were conceptual. It was then I learned how to look at conceptual art and new media. I can say it was a period of me coming back to life, of relaxing. And it made me feel like painting again. But I'd lost all ambition. I just took some canvasses I had lying around at home and started painting (the beginning of  Stalin’s Tomb) inspired by a little second-hand book about a USSR Congress when Khrushchev tried a move to get Stalin removed from the mausoleum where he was buried next to Lenin. Khrushchev had no clue about how to get that criminal out of there, so he orchestrated a kind of mystical happening during the congress, a veteran female bolshevist, who'd been a bolshevist since the age of 2, stood up and said she'd dreamed of Vladimir Ilyich the night before. And he'd told her that he didn't feel good at all with Stalin lying next to him, in fact he stunk to high heaven, and he was telling her so she could tell everyone at the congress that he'd like to be alone in the mausoleum. The proposal was put to vote, and on that night they sent in an excavator, took him out, made a 6-metre deep hole, stuck him in it, and they poured in 6 metres of reinforced concrete, they totally threw him out. I wanted to paint this whole story somehow. So that's how the first two paintings came about. After a while, I showed them to Mihai, he liked them, and said if I made several of them, we would put on an exhibition at Plan B. So, in September 2006, we held the If You Open It You Get Dirty exhibition. In the same period, Jane came to Romania, she told us that she knew a gallery in London which had a branch in Zurich, and that the branch director, Juerg Judin, might be interested in doing a show together. Judin already knew Mircea Cantor, who was in Paris, and wanted to come here and meet us. In September, he came to Cluj and saw my exhibition, and then in November he organised Cluj Connection, a group exhibition, which I was in alongside Mircea Cantor, Victor Man, Ciprian Mureșan, Cristi Pogăcean, Șerban Savu and Gabriela Vanga. The Zürich exhibition was an instant hit. Overnight I went from being a total nobody, just imagine that during the summer I'd been a nobody reading about Khrushchev and some Russian lady's dreams, while in November I'd already received a proposal to work with Haunch of Venison. Haunch was a big deal then, I mean just think, at that time they had Bill Viola, Richard Long, Damien Hirst. A list of at least 6 artists who I'd learned about at uni. In November, we were already working with them. That's how it went….\nDid you guys end up being grouped together because of people like Jane Neal, or were you close anyway? We were close. You could say we were a gang. A gang with its own tension, I mean don't think that there was endless love between us or anything. How do you see yourself without them ? I can't, I don't think I can see myself without them. I don't know if you can ever look at an artist in vitro, completely out of context. In all of us there's some interest for things which can be transferred from one to another, we're not completely separate. For example, at the beginning, each one had his own way of seeing things based on his life history. Șerban Savu, who'd spent his whole life in a block of flats in Mănăștur, painted what he saw from the balcony. Victor Man lived in an old, nationalised house on Horea Street in Cluj, next to the station, an Austro-Hungarian atmosphere, old furniture etc.. He'd always had a feeling for the past, a sort of nostalgia for a lost world whose tracks were still visible, dirty, grand, old doors, the way his grandma cooked. Everyone talked about Romania, but it wasn't an abstract concept, it was a kind of flavour, a nuance, something between worlds. Like the layer of jam in a cake – without it it's either too sweet or too dry. It's about that, not about illustrating or narrating something. What I'm interested in, for example, is a certain kind of texture, a specific dirtiness which wasn't to be found just in Romania but in the whole of Eastern Europe, dirt induced by a specific ideology, a specific way of life, a mixture of a rusty, old Dacia, ’50s furniture covered in bric-a-brac, my gran's old mouldy carpet… Each one of us has his own aroma, that kind of nuance. To me it seemed like Bucharest artists were really interested in narrative, in explaining, in making political statements. We had no wish to explain ourselves ideologically. We weren't necessarily thinking about that. The world we lived in has its own texture which was different, and each of us tried to capture that in our painting (Ciprian did the same, only in new media). For you to look at a painting and have the impression not that you understand the historical background, but that you can smell a certain type of mould, which isn't there because people forgot about their old things, but because people were forced to forget them. There's a whole thing behind it. Do you have a specific work rhythm? I work from December to March, I mean really work, I have no life apart from that, from dawn 'til dusk. At one moment you get into a kind of trance, as if you're dancing, like a dervish. At the beginning you might feel a bit sick, then you dance for a while, and, if you've got the right rhythm, you can stay in it, kind of like warming up, then just moving by itself. If I asked you to dance right now, you might be clumsy at first, but after a few moves around the place, you'd be fine. So I prefer getting into this whirling motion and then I don't come out of it for about two months. I don't paint with a brush, I paint with a whole load of tools, in fact, I throw colours around in one big mess, I have to be in the right state. It exhausts me and depresses me. I have the feeling the world is far away and that I'm a loser. That's it, exhaustion. And you're all alone, it's an idiotic occupation because you go home, open a door, shut it again, you're on your own the whole time. You're alone with your own stuff, it's not something you can share with others.\n When did you realise you were a 'successful painter’? When I was painting Stalin’s Tomb, my series of graves, I would look at one of my works in my mum's kitchen, at home, where I would paint when she wasn't cooking, mostly at night. It was a colourless piece, a grey thing, in fact it was a stove lid turned the other way round, covered in dust. In a way, this work contradicts that whole list of reasons why someone would like a painting, it's got nothing about it to like. Some time passed between the moment I painted it to when it was exhibited. I spent a lot of time with it, it was really just like a grey stain, it was almost like my own personal secret, as if only I knew what it was about and there was no sense explaining. I knew that, for anyone else apart from me, it would just be a grey stain with a handle. I never understood why there was such a fuss about that piece at the Zürich exhibition. At that time, it was a complete mystery to me… Have you found an answer for that in the meantime? Sort of… We like things from the darker side of life. Somewhere, inside us, we feel attracted to this. And I think there's something present in my work, something malefic, because it's the work of someone interested in those type of things, but not from some positivist, Western perspective. I totally believe in this layer. If someone told me it didn't exist, that it's a by-product, a chemical reaction in my brain, then they'd be giving me an answer I'm not interested in. Have you ever been interested in exploring your own subconscious? I've never had psychoanalysis. Not even keeping a dream journal? No. And do you know what? I remember two moments which you could consider kind of creepy. I've seen two car accidents close up. One with five dead. I was about eleven, a lorry drove into a Dacia in front of me, it pushed the car into the railings, it crushed it, they all turned upside down. Basically that's like a tank driving into your Dacia. On Calea Turzii in Cluj. I was right there, at a zebra crossing, and I saw the whole thing. People had already gathered around, there was a band of people at the front, and I knew the moment would come when the victims would be pulled out from the car. I said to myself, 'Mate, do you want to see or not?' I had to make a decision. I said, 'I'll watch, whatever happens.' I saw exactly the kind of thing that only images from Auschwitz can rival. Two firemen pulling out a body with its insides all hanging out, and not just one, five of them. Just like meat stew. What's strange is that it didn't affect me, I didn't dream about it. Later, when I went to dissection classes in the first year of uni, I looked with a kind of curiosity, not with any negative connotation. And when I was between 10 and 12, my dad gave me a book on Buchenwald to read, it was a novel, in fact, with pictures too though, which told you how people had murdered others at Bergen Belsen and Buchenwald. I was totally fascinated and horrified, and I couldn't put the book down. I think there's a layer in all of us we don't talk about, which we've covered with shows like Duminica în familie or Oprah, where conversations about human nature are a kind of la-la poetry, every day we make up lies that we're rational animals, we talk very little about this, we prefer Oprah to thinking about what's forming in that layer and really hard to express in words. I mean, look, people might say that I'm an arrogant bloke, famous for his indifference to socialising, replying to e-mails, but they don't know how much I'm interested in people, in the sense that I prefer not interacting with them because I can observe them better when I'm not talking to them. Often when I am talking to them, I find out the least. I'm also interested in finding out what's going on with me, it's me who's part of this whole thing.\n Is that why you appear in a series of self portraits? Yes,  Self portrait as... I'm neither an historian nor a philosopher, I'm not reinventing the wheel. If someone asked me how I see painting, I'd say that, after it lost the illustrative rôle it had in centuries past, when, because there were no video cameras yet, you had to illustrate certain things, painting is the only medium for expressing the visceral nature of the world. Any painting is the result of a physical interaction, you can't imagine how inert a colour is when you put it on your palette, the decomposed version, blobs of colour awaiting transformation. They're only transformed through a choreography which can't be prescribed, there are no recipes, nor knowing exactly what quantities to use, what follows is a Brownian motion dictated by my insides, by my moods. If my meniscus is playing up, then after two hours of standing up I'd need to sit down. And then I'd paint in a chair, it's a completely different dynamic. Your health issues, your limits, you can see all these in what you paint. It's all about your viscerality. No other medium can do that. You're on the art market now, your work is being sold for higher and higher prices. Do you feel that market expectations restrict your freedom? As an artist, you have the same problems society does: you have to take your daily dose of freedom. The market's like the rising of the sun: you can't stop it, there's no sense in getting annoyed with it, you don't control it. It's always been there and always will be. It's the stupidest thing to imagine that something exists which doesn't come under the market's radar. In fact, the market doesn't mean Sotheby’s, it's a kind of convention between a few people who believe in what you're doing, they invest a certain amount, cultural or financial, so that sometime, at the end, someone will say, 'I want it, it's mine!' The whole Sotheby's thing has nothing to do with me. My paintings are not mine. They were painted by me, sold to some collectors a few years ago, and they resold them. People have the impression that I make loads of money from it. But it's not like that. Whether the market's behind you or not, when you go into your studio it's the same problem, particularly because Sotheby's or the market are not the only sources which can influence your freedom. The opinion of a very close friend can be much more devastating, or an awful press review, someone who accuses you of God knows what. You have to earn your freedom every day. But in Romania there's still this naivety of splitting the world into the market and outside of the market. People say, 'Well you've had commercial success, but in the museum world, you've had nothing.' But there's no such thing as in vitro commercial success. Those people paid $2 million for what? Commercial success is mostly the secondary effect of your success as an artist, first of all. Bacon and Warhol were in the same auction as me. I'm not saying it's OK for me to be there. It seems to me I'm much too young. And nobody asks me when they do these things. Maybe I'll tell them at one point, 'It seems a little crazy, at 37, for me to be selling a painting at Sotheby’s for almost $2 million. It's stupid. Much too early, much too much.' Some parts of the market work strangely. But I have absolutely no influence over that.\n Adrian Ghenie, „Self-portrait in 1945”, 2015. Have you ever felt a kind of guilt projected onto you because your work sells well? Yes. How do you explain this? Where does this idea come from? In Romania, there's an old tradition of explaining someone else's success through the occult tale, 'Yeah, right, I know better than you how these things happen...' It's a tradition which will never die. And then the conspiracy story follows. That doesn't affect me at all. The whole thing with Sotheby's, hyped up by the media, has put me on an island. But I never gave any kind of statement, I haven't said anything, I don't feed it. And I have another theory: somewhere between 25 and 45 years old you've got a sort of 'primetime,' in this timeframe it's a complete waste of time explaining anything or giving interviews. You can all think what you like. After 50, then we'll do some clarifying. Until then, life's amazing. I'm not the type of person who likes going on holiday. I just don't like it, I get bored. I'm a workaholic. Maybe I'll make a film at one point… I don't want to sit in press conferences, I don't want to explain. I don't have time for that. In a world where everyone wants to communicate something, it's precisely communicating which becomes irrelevant. I don't want to communicate anything any more. Do you feel any kind of fear hanging over you when you go into your studio? I don't necessarily feel afraid, but I do know exactly what I'm going to have to go through when I come in here and decide to paint until a certain time. I know that the secret to any good artwork is managing failure. The secret ingredient for any piece of art, whether it's literature, painting or something else, is, in fact, something like the following: you start off amazingly, and then, somewhere along the line, you really fuck up. If I've started something at 3 in the afternoon, at about 9 in the evening I'll be standing there with a cigarette in my hand, saying, 'My God, I've really messed this shit up, at 5 it looked incredible, but then I kept saying I should fix it up a little.' At that moment, you've got two choices: you can light up another cigarette and say, 'I'm going home to sleep, I'll come back tomorrow all fresh and new,' which is just foolish. Feeling fresh won't solve anything. I didn't know this at the beginning, I learned it in time. In fact, at that moment, your brain wraps up the situation tragically, in economic terms: you've lost six hours, you've used up all these supplies. You make yourself a failure checklist, you should feel frustrated, down, but, as things went on I noticed that there's another part of your brain which tells you: 'Don't you realise that right now you've got a once-in-a-lifetime chance?' There's a unique moment of liberation, now that the piggy's officially dead in its sty. Now you can allow yourself to say: 'What would happen if I took that detail which I slogged over for 5 hours and threw a bit of yellow over it, the one colour that all of your painting technique know-how says you shouldn't put there? And I use exactly that yellow, and not just any yellow, but citrus yellow, and not just a little smudge, but five whole tubes, I squeeze them all out there. Then I notice that something's happened, nothing to do with my technique, but with a certain energy. I've played a kind of Russian roulette. And then, often, but not always, by destroying a face or some detail, things take on a new dynamic. This notion of managing failure is in fact the only way something can break through. The awful thing though is that I can't fake this failure, I really have to believe right up 'til the end that this little detail has to be that way. It wears me down knowing that I leave just before messing up.\n It sounds like failure has become something essential to you… Yes, it’s become a necessary ingredient. My series, Stalin’s Tomb, wasn't necessarily painted in that vein, it came through another type of failure, the failure of my life up to that moment, as an artist, as a person. Now I need that kind of failure somewhere in my studio. Success, just like comfort, kills art actually. People are going to tell me I'm a hypocrite for saying that. The big problem with galleries, for example, is that it's in their job description to ensure you a certain comfort level. It's very difficult to explain to them that it's exactly that comfort level that's going to kill their artists. I've got money, but I don't live comfortably. I pay rent, I spend all my time in spaces like this, I wear the same clothes every day, months on end, I don't have a car, I don't own possessions, I've just got one armchair I bought from an antiques store. I haven't changed my lifestyle. My bank balance has changed due to these things, but it's something beyond me, and the money's used to pay for all kind of things, to support a load of projects. My own personal comfort level hasn't changed at all. I don't eat caviar. I don't travel business class, I don't own suits… We don't empathise with success because it's essentially foreign to our nature. The more successful you are, the more of an island you become for others, a detestable creature. People who know me personally don't detest me, only those who don't know me personally do, because they loathe a media-made image: 'successful, young painter.' Even I hate him. The media tends to present a Hollywood version of your life. That's what Bacon used to say, until you're 50 there's no time for explaining. Leonardo da Vinci never gave an interview and that didn’t change much. We haven't talked about colour. Why does your work sometimes explode with colour, while other times it's so very dark? I'm classed as a portrait painter, the polar opposite of pure abstract art. There is distinct figuration in my painting. The reasons why I'm a figurative artist and I'm not really abstract are more emotional and are to do with how I relate myself to traditional figurative painting. The moment a painting comes close to figurative and I have to think in a figurative way, paint eyes, a mouth, that's exactly when I don’t find painting interesting any more. Any kind of narrating you try to do on a canvas is essentially not interesting, attempting to imitate texture using a brush is, in itself, a waste of time. That's why I haven't concentrated much on 20th century figurative painting, but on 20th century abstract painting. I've tried to create figurative painting, but using the building bricks of abstract: Pollock-like spraying, some things from Rothko, all those blobs you can see on my recent work which I took from Gorki, areas of decalcomania in the style of Max Ernst, all these are abstract painting tools. Somewhere along the line, my playing with them should generate figurative images. But I don't paint a tree trying to imitate its shadows or colours. A while ago, when I was thinking about how best to suggest a rotten old piece of wooden furniture of my gran's, I realised that the best way would be to use a specific kind of intervention à la Richter. I put Richter in my gran's furniture. I didn't take things from my classmates. Richter, just like Bacon, are already history, a ready-made tool, you can just take them off the shelf. That's what I've always found interesting, taking a bit from here, a bit from there, like a German Shepherd rounding up all his sheep, and to create figurative work using the abstract painting toolkit. I was just thinking about the figures you rough up, you assault, you attack, a sort of unmasking of official history. How do you place yourself in terms of history: are you the one that rewrites the official version, the one who corrects it? Not necessarily. I'm interested in history that’s linked to the the human figure. A certain type of deconstruction interests me, the same way it interested Picasso and Bacon. In the 20th century there were two moments when the way human figures were painted completely changed — Picasso and Bacon. Picasso's deconstruction is inspired by African art and the Middle Ages, he sometimes painted eyes on only one side of the face, but the figures are very decorative. There's no texture, no meat,they're just like a collage suggesting human figures. Bacon creates the same deconstruction, but it's all very carnal, you've got the impression that his model's a head that’s been cut off by a warlord and then stuck back on again. When I found an image taken from a film of a pie fight, completely by accident, I asked myself what exactly I was seeing, in fact: a man or a woman, with bits of cake running down their face. One eye is clear and looking at you, while the other is covered by smeared cake. A deconstruction is taking place, but it's not one created by me. My paintings look similar to Francis Bacon's work, but he was actually the one doing the deconstructing, using an internal mechanism, while I take them ready-made, already deconstructed, from the stock of images I have to hand. That's what's new in the world: you've got access to an infinite database of images and data. I haven't done anything else apart from just take from that, using the traditional deconstruction of human images, which the cinema world has supplied me with. I just scan my options and take whatever seems expressive enough or 'paintable.' People say that Francis Bacon is one of my inspirations. Yes, our work is similar, but he created them, while I find them.\n How do you see the famous Degenerate Art Exhibition? I'd class that along with the Holocaust, in a Dadaesque way, because they had the same roots, they are a result of humiliation. To me it's something like Nazis fleeing to South America and not being caught until they died. Humanity's failure, in a way. The whole time we create systems we think are perfect, we barricade ourselves in using law and economics, and then we mess up... Just like our whole legal system wasn't capable of agreeing those guys were monsters, this Degenerate Art Exhibition was also the world failing, society failing, it’s much more than people saying things like, 'It's such a shame about those paintings, I feel so sorry for those artists!' Those artists found another niche, they survived, I'm not talking about that. It's the same as burning books, these are failures. The failure of a whole system. It's not about the fact that some books were burned, there'll be other ones. But every now and then, this machinery called society totally botches things up. And from these things you learn so much. It's these things that make you realise that this whole construction is relative. Humanity's biggest failures weren't things like Napoleon's invasion of Russia, they were this kind of thing. The whole time we're under the impression that we're somehow scot-free, that we live in a democracy and 'these things won't happen again.' No way! To be capable of burning books in public squares or putting on exhibitions of Degenerate Art, you have to be part of a whole web of people. It wasn't just Goebbels who wanted to do these things. A whole load of people did, and I'm not talking about factory workers, but about cultured people, who came to the conclusion that that art was rubbish. In fact, the responsibility for it is kind of spread out, it's not just what's-his-name's who took the decision, but the whole machinery’s responsibility. It reminded me of what Hannah Arendt said about the banality of evil... Yes, and this is just one face of this evil. It's incredible how many failures of this kind we've managed to create in the 20th century. In a moment of madness, I watched tens of hours from the Eichmann trial, the whole thing's on the Internet. It's simply what they recorded on the scene, a trial which lasted two months. And every day there was a session lasting about two hours, let's say. And a gaggle of translators translating for you. And do you know what was fascinating after I-don't-know-how many hours? You go through exactly what happens to the judge on the rostrum, as in that, at one moment, you fall into a kind of stupor, a sort of bureaucratic hypnosis. At the beginning it's all very formal, everyone's standing up, Eichmann's accused of crimes, then the guy starts with all these papers, going into detail about how everything worked, and at one point even the judge says to him, 'Yes, thank you,' he becomes a partner. You realise how complicated the trial is, because there's a load of things that need to be cleared up, we're getting things straight for humanity, for the Jewish people, and so you say, 'Hang on, so if we're really talking, then let's go into all the details.' How many trains? How did it go? Who sent them? And you realise the accused becomes your partner, the judge almost says 'Danke' to him, he feels grateful and says 'this gentleman is clearing things up for us,' and then you're almost so bored you feel like saying, 'Ok, mate, enough now, I get it, so maybe it wasn't so...' If you go into so much detail, at one point this stupor takes over, it’s almost like evil becomes palatable. The Nazis, just like the Communists, knew that bureaucracy would create a kind of balm, a liquid so easy to slip into, which turns the situation to jelly, it makes it almost tolerable.\n Why have you chosen to paint primarily dictators? Because they're such a clichée and have generated the same visual baggage. It would have been completely pointless painting Beria because there are only two photos of him. I would've ended up in an elitist area which I hate. I want to work with exactly the kind of junk we all have in our collective mentality. That's why I've never used rare images of Hitler, Stalin or Ceaușescu, and why I've used the ones we all saw at school, the ones on book covers. I've gone along with democratising access to information, which is specific to our time. Fifty years ago you couldn't have done that. You had to go to the library and ask the lady there to give you some book or other and you might have found something in that. One of the big advantages of our time is that we have access to this huge collection of images. And I wouldn't like it to become classified, something only I have access to. In a conversation with Mihai Pop, you said you read the daily press every morning. Do you still do that? Yes. As I don't believe in information hierarchy and I don't believe a piece of news about Silviu Prigoană is less important than something about this or that crisis, it all tells us about human nature, I jump from one to the other. Because I often paint until late, I smoke a lot, and, when I wake up in the morning, I'm half-dead for the first hour. I have my iPhone next to me and go to Ziare.com or search for a name, something I dreamed last night. So I get to Ziare, completely in a daze, because I've just woken up, and then I see a piece: X has got new false tits. Who's X? Ah, it's her. I like the randomness on Ziare.com of associating 'Poroshenko has reached an agreement,' with 'First Romanian man to get breast implants,' and 'What's-his-name's hat has been found.' That's how I wake up. Then I choose something from there. For example, one day I saw that a certain number of years had passed since the signing of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact. There was a photo of Ribbentrop, Molotov, Stalin, and behind them was some panelling, and I was thinking: I wonder where this document which had such a huge impact on a large parts of the world was signed? What's that room all about? I mean the work it took… I searched for 'the building Ribbentrop-Molotov pact' and didn't find anything. Then I searched differently, I put 'Pact Building' through Google Translate to see it in Russian, and after about two hours I found it. It's a restaurant. I found a picture of two people having a meal, eating a fish, and behind them is the same panelling. Have you used that information in any way? I don't know, no idea. What I'm saying is that I like doing that kind of thing. I find it funny you read Ziare.com and not NewYorkTimes.com. I don't read The New York Times. And if we've got onto what's culturally acceptable and what's not... Tabloid news is like rummaging around in a rubbish bin. For example, for a while I've been interested in this disease some people suffer from, which gets worse and worse and nobody talks about it: dysmorphia. The worst form of dysmorphia is when you hate your body or hate a limb. Some people go to psychologists to get written permission to cut of their perfectly normal leg, because they're obsessed that it's revolting. They say, 'If I can't cut off my leg, I'll kill myself.' It's all explained in Greek mythology, Narcissus etc.. From the moment we had mirrors, and from the moment we had an anti-mirror called the media and saw all these cover images, we began suffering in silence from dysmorphia, began hating ourselves. We hate ourselves now more than ever. I sometimes meet art collectors who are cosmetic surgeons, and they tell me that 80% of their patients should be sent to a psychiatrist. The world is like an iceberg, and this is the unseen part of the world, what people say. All these obsessions are silent, but they affect such an enormous number of people. There's a very aggressive and dark partnership between all the industries – medical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic.\n Adrian Ghenie, „Nickelodeon”, 2008. What's your relationship like with Romania? From 2002 on, from the moment I left for the first time and have been travelling back and forth ever since, I've been able to understand Romania much better than if I'd have stayed there, and I have a much closer relationship now. I've fallen back in love with Romania precisely because I've been away. Over the years, I've realised how much I owe Romania, as my biggest asset is the fact I was born there, that I was there for a specific time period, and from that perspective I can understand other perspectives, more angles, relating to Europe, relating to the world in general. It's trendy to say that Romania is a complete disaster, but it doesn't seem like that to me at all. It's the first time in Romanian history that, physically-speaking, the whole population has been able to go abroad. At least one visit. Almost every Romanian you ask, even an old granny from this or that village, has gone to visit a relative in Italy. Your average Romanian has stepped out into the world and has seen for himself what it’s like. That seems essential to me. And as for me, I live in Berlin for purely personal reasons. I don't intend on dying here. It's the context of my life as it is now. I didn't come to Berlin because I hate Romania. It's probably the same kind of rationale Brâncuși had when he left for Paris. Why have you decided now, at this point in your career, to represent Romania at the Venice Biennale? Initially, when Mihai Pop suggested it, I refused. After which I realised that, besides the idea of representing Romania, I needed another reason, a purely artistic one. Painting has been quite foreign to the Venice Biennale, at least over the last 20 years. Even though there've been painting exhibitions every now and then, it hasn't been their favourite medium. People say that if you want to put together a country stand, you can't do a painting exhibition, you've got to do something complex, painting's much too traditional. So then I said to myself, 'OK, it's a good moment for a painting exhibition, to put myself in that hostile context and see how I do.' In a way, the circuit I've been in until now has something vitro about it, a kind of cocoon which you make for yourself. It becomes comfortable. The Biennale won't be comfortable.\n Why? Because there you see how good your painting really is, whether it has the power to persuade. And again, that type of pressure isn't comfortable, now, in a way, I feel a bit like a plane taking off, like the point of no return, I have to do this and I have to take it to the limit, it forces me into higher revs. There's going to be a horribly mixed audience, they'll all be there, from painting groupies to it's worst critics. And so that's why I said, 'At the end of the day, why not?' Many people think you're playing it safe… Not at all, it's the most hostile environment for painting you could possibly imagine. I'm not going to Venice to hit nails in walls and hang up paintings, I don't want to do a conventional painting exhibition. Your initial project for the exhibition included Adam Curtis as a guest, the author of a series of documentaries about 20th century history seen from the perspective of power. I understand that whilst working on the Biennale exhibition, copyright problems appeared and that the BBC won't allow Curtis' material to be broadcasted outside of their programmes. How big a role did Curtis play in your project and how have you reworked the exhibition without him? My invitation to Adam, to contribute to my exhibition, came as a natural result of meetings with him over the last year, in which we discussed how we can understand history from a psychoanalytical perspective. My collaboration with Adam Curtis has no deadline nor obligations, even though the BBC – through its well-known protectionist policies – finally decided not to allow his participation in Venice. Seven months of broadcasting Adam Curtis' work outside of the BBC and the Commonwealth is apparently unacceptable for them. The visual busyness of Curtis' films, and the way he uses a catalogue of raw, juxtaposed images from history, have had a powerful impact on my painting over the last few years. My conversations with Curtis have rearranged the way I work with historical material, getting further away from narrating history and closer to history's contradictions. I'd say that for me (and for the proposal Mihai Pop and I made to him for the pavilion) Adam Curtis has had the role of a catalyst, which, with or without the films he put together to match my painting, has stayed intact.\n Why 'Darwin's Room'? From my point of view, Darwin is not a closed book, there was life before and after him, the paradigm he changed is much too large to have been fully digested. I have the feeling that everything which happened in the 20th century has its roots in him, from Marx to eugenics to modern racism. In fact, it's a totally current thing. Terrorists, for example, are fighting against a world which embraces Darwin. Western positivism, where everything's rational, has a cause and an effect, doesn't really match the irrational way of the old world, which they still believe in. Darwin is the person who, for the first time, proved something scientifically which took the God debate into a completely different area. And I think it hasn't been fully digested, not even now. That, let's say, could be its thematic explanation. It's essentially a painting exhibition, but it contains some ingredients which make it much more than that. I don't want to put on just a solo painting show.

Ghenie depicts the iconic scientist seated amid a blazing autumnal landscape. He is swaddled in a polychrome blanket of blue and orange, with his face partly masked by Baconesque smears of violet. Every inch of the painting is alive with texture. Bright yellows, rich golds and deep reds ripple, melt, buckle and blur together in shimmering symphony. In some areas, Ghenie has created vaporous, smoky blooms of colour by pressing flat the stillwet surface, or scraping through it in the manner of Gerhard Richter; elsewhere, bright licks of impasto build the pigment into nearsculptural presence. Masked-off flashes of marbled paint—evoking autumn leaves and tongues of flame alike—hover like collage, sitting proud of the canvas in crisp, three-dimensional focus. A touch of Titian-blue sky breaks through at the upper right. Flickering between abstraction and figuration, Charles Darwin at the Age of 75 pictures a moment that Darwin did not in fact live to see: he passed away at the age of 73, in 1882. Ghenie’s painting—as with many of his works— is less a portrait of the man himself than an inquiry into his complex legacy. Ghenie first showed Charles Darwin at the Age of 75 as part of a 2014 show in Pace Gallery’s space at 6 Burlington Gardens: an imposing Italianate building which stands behind the very room where Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace presented the theory on the origin of species to the Linnean Society in July 1858. There, it was shown alongside Ghenie’s installation Darwin’s Room and eight other paintings, including two in which the artist merged his own selfportrait with Darwin’s image. ‘For me, chronology doesn’t exist in art. Caravaggio and de Kooning were trying to solve the same problem. Deep inside every painting exists a deep abstract challenge’ Adrian Ghenie Born in Romania under the regime of Nicolae Ceau?escu and currently based in Berlin, Ghenie has long been captivated by the darker forces that shaped the twentieth century and continue to impact our present. He often works from black-and-white photographs he finds online, zoning in on powerful figures and pivotal moments that have left indelible marks on history. His subjects have included scientists, artists and dictators, with a particular emphasis on the legacy of the Second World War, and on the looming spectre of fascism in all its forms. Darwin, whose theories of evolution and natural selection have been mendaciously seized and twisted by a number of racist, eugenicist and genocidal regimes, provides a fascinating fulcrum for these issues. As the curator Jasper Sharp writes, ‘The basis of [Darwin’s] theories lay in scholarly curiosity. Subjected over time to the mechanisms of corruption, they have led to the most terrible and dangerous ignorance. There is the world before Darwin, Ghenie points out, and the world after him. The two are very different places, a paradigm apart’ (J. Sharp, ‘The Flycatcher’, in Adrian Ghenie: Golems, exh. cat. Pace Gallery, London 2014, p. 7). The rich surface of Charles Darwin at the Age of 75 seems to enact the warping to which Darwin’s ideas have been subjected. The scientist’s face has even taken on an ape-like cast, perhaps reflecting the caricatures that mocked his ideas during his lifetime. Darwin is no longer in control of his image, and the picture churns in metamorphosis. Rather than offering any fixed viewpoint, Ghenie’s extraordinary paintwork asserts history— and Darwin’s place within it—as layered, mutable, and complex; the autumnal hues capture a scene of uncertainty and flux, as one season shifts into another. In tandem with his dialogue with historical events, Ghenie’s work is animated by a deep love for the history of art. He hybridises, mutates and cross-pollinates ideas and techniques from a range of sources, creating his own unique species of painting. As a young painter, he sought to emulate artists like Rembrandt, to whom he had been drawn since he was a child: he concealed this interest from his teachers at the art academy in Cluj, who advocated an Abstract Expressionist style of painting. As his practice deepened, he began to enfold a kaleidoscopic array of allusion into his works, drawing on centuries of painterly achievement. In Charles Darwin at the Age of 75, the setting whirls with Baroque, chiaroscuro grandeur; Darwin’s face echoes the turbulent, ghostly visages of Francis Bacon; abstract passages invoke Richter’s scraping technique and the gestural vigour of de Kooning alike. ‘You can’t invent a painting from scratch; you are working with an entire tradition,’ Ghenie explains. ‘The pictorial language of the twentieth century, from Kurt Schwitters’s collages to Jackson Pollock’s drip paintings, makes up a range of possibilities that I utilise in order to create a transhistorical figurative painting—a painting of the image as such, of representation’ (A. Ghenie in conversation with M. Radu, Adrian Ghenie: Darwin’s Room, exh. cat. Romanian Pavilion, Biennale de Venezia 2015, p. 31). ‘The surfaces have an eddying quality as though looking at the surface of water or into an aquarium … Fluctuations of this kind extend the metaphor pertaining to Darwin’s own personality and reputation’ Christopher Lloyd Ghenie understands painting as a space of illusion. Like a cinema screen, the canvas is a surface for projecting stories through colour and form. ‘I’m jealous of the specific power of cinema to build a virtual state,’ he has said, ‘and of its capacity to break with reality. For two hours you’re completely under its spell! … I’d like to bring something of this magic, of this entire force, into painting’ (A. Ghenie in conversation with M. Pop, in ibid., p. 83). He especially admires the work of David Lynch, whose disquieting, dreamlike movies are laden with the sense that dark and mysterious currents are at work behind the scenes. It is no accident that Ghenie’s paintings are composed with a virtuoso sense of illumination, performance and suspense. Taking place on a vast, immersive scale, the present work is constructed like a stage, with the figure spotlit in dramatic focus and framed by carefully-deployed swathes of light and darkness. The same plastic chair on which Darwin sits—which can be found in Ghenie’s studio, and recurs in a number of paintings—in fact played a central role in the Darwin’s Room installation, where it was placed at a light-filled window beneath a spiral staircase. In his composition of this room and its objects, Ghenie again blurred the boundaries between painting and set design: its physical layout was based on Rembrandt’s 1632 painting Philosopher in Meditation. ‘Each of the portraits communicates an atmosphere of turbulence, its subject obscured and any great detail wilfully corrupted. They seem to play on Darwin’s inherent ambiguity, on the lingering sense of conflict that his name invariably evokes, without ever going so far as to cast judgment. He is, the paintings remind us, different things to different people’ Jasper Sharp While he revels in painting’s theatricality, Ghenie also sees the medium as a way of restoring a form of material reality to the contemporary gaze. He speaks of remembering his own favourite paintings by their ‘temperature’: of experiencing them somatically, sensually, in a way that cannot be replicated through a flat digital display. ‘My generation knows what life was like before the Internet’, he says. ‘And so you still happen to hear echoes of the old world when you wake up in the morning … you realize that the world is changing its texture, is changing its skin. I am very sensitive to this aspect’ (A. Ghenie in conversation with M. Radu, in ibid., p. 32). By splicing, remixing and deconstructing different modes of representation, Ghenie’s paintings examine the various artificial lenses through which we see our present, as well as those which overlay our past. Charles Darwin at the Age of 75 glimmers like a mirage, on the verge of melting away. Yet to encounter it is also to feel a visceral, physical and vital presence—to be brought face to face with painting as a force of nature. While Ghenie explores the dark places of history, he also celebrates paint’s power to help us see the world and ourselves more clearly. In this sense, as quests for understanding complexity, his art and Darwin’s science are perhaps not so distantly related.\n ; 22 Jul Article.\nUpdated: art exhibitions and events from summer 2021 — Asia, Africa, Australia, Latin America and the Middle East.\n6 Apr Article.\nCollecting guide: Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.\n15 Dec Video.\nDegas and the dance: why the artist’s behind-the-curtain approach was revelatory \n", "label": [[8, 21, "ARTIST"], [26, 30, "DATE"], [32, 63, "WORK_OF_ART"], [82, 88, "ARTIST"], [89, 93, "DATE"], [174, 178, "DATE"], [191, 203, "GALLERY"], [205, 211, "GPE"], [269, 273, "GALLERY"], [275, 281, "GPE"], [283, 296, "ARTIST"], [298, 304, "WORK_OF_ART"], [306, 310, "DATE"], [343, 353, "MUSEUM"], [355, 361, "GPE"], [363, 376, "ARTIST"], [378, 382, "DATE"], [420, 426, "GPE"], [428, 432, "GALLERY"], [434, 447, "ARTIST"], [457, 473, "DATE"], [475, 481, "GPE"], [483, 493, "MUSEUM"], [495, 508, "ARTIST"], [510, 539, "DATE"], [1045, 1076, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1078, 1082, "DATE"], [1117, 1130, "ARTIST"], [1158, 1164, "ARTIST"], [1524, 1530, "ARTIST"], [1655, 1670, "ARTIST"], [2032, 2063, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2159, 2163, "DATE"], [2165, 2171, "ARTIST"], [2289, 2295, "ARTIST"], [2309, 2340, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2354, 2358, "DATE"], [2367, 2379, "GALLERY"], [2590, 2599, "DATE"], [2631, 2637, "ARTIST"], [2653, 2666, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2819, 2829, "ARTIST"], [2834, 2844, "ARTIST"], [2945, 2958, "ARTIST"], [2967, 2974, "GPE"], [3036, 3042, "GPE"], [3044, 3050, "ARTIST"], [3730, 3742, "CURATOR"], [3960, 3966, "ARTIST"], [4058, 4066, "ARTIST"], [4089, 4110, "EVENT"], [4122, 4134, "GALLERY"], [4136, 4142, "GPE"], [4143, 4147, "DATE"], [4176, 4207, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4543, 4549, "ARTIST"], [4802, 4808, "ARTIST"], [5056, 5065, "ARTIST"], [5182, 5186, "GPE"], [5392, 5423, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5535, 5548, "ARTIST"], [5575, 5582, "ARTIST"], [5631, 5641, "ARTIST"], [5735, 5741, "ARTIST"], [5783, 5800, "DATE"], [5807, 5822, "ARTIST"], [5837, 5852, "ARTIST"], [6030, 6039, "ARTIST"], [6070, 6098, "EVENT"], [6129, 6148, "EVENT"], [6149, 6153, "DATE"], [6384, 6390, "ARTIST"], [6791, 6800, "ARTIST"], [6822, 6828, "CURATOR"], [6882, 6893, "ARTIST"], [7044, 7050, "ARTIST"], [7400, 7406, "ARTIST"], [7490, 7503, "WORK_OF_ART"], [7640, 7646, "ARTIST"], [7742, 7751, "ARTIST"], [7754, 7758, "DATE"], [7768, 7793, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8157, 8169, "CURATOR"], [8215, 8221, "ARTIST"], [8780, 8789, "ARTIST"], [8914, 8920, "ARTIST"], [9046, 9077, "WORK_OF_ART"], [9277, 9283, "ARTIST"], [9596, 9600, "DATE"], [9603, 9607, "GPE"], [9609, 9615, "GPE"], [9617, 9626, "GPE"], [9628, 9641, "GPE"], [9650, 9661, "GPE"]]}
{"id": 16, "data": "Events 20 November 2021.\nAdrian Ghenie – among the best sold painters in the world Adrian Ghenie Adrian Ghenie was born on the 13th of August 1977 in the city of Baia Mare, Romania. His parents weren’t artists, but his talent was spotted by one of their neighbors, who brought him art books and helped him develop his drawing skills. Ghenie says that it is because of her that he became an artist. He studied at the University of Arts and Design in Cluj-Napoca, and had the well reputed Ioan Sbarciu as his professor. Then, he founded the gallery Plan B, which he extended to Berlin as well. This kept him travelling between Berlin and Cluj-Napoca until finally moving to the German capital in 2013. He has his own studio there, which used to be a garage and a gallery.  He is a rather unconventional painter, using a palette knife and stencils instead of brushes. Ghenie says that due to this technique, most of the elements in his paintings are actually the result of accident and not of the artist’s intention. He further explains that using these utensils can destroy the canvas, but if it doesn’t, then it turns it into something beautiful. Because painting to him is like a game of Russian roulette. From a distance, Ghenie’s paintings seem neat, but when you get closer, you see the imprecise contours and the spontaneity of his technique. He is an internationally known artist, his works being displayed by some of the most important galleries in the world, even the Center “Georges Pompidou”. One of his famous admirers is François Pinault, the CEO of the Kering group.  Some of Ghenie’s most successful pieces are “The Fake Rothko”, which was sold by Sotheby’s for 1,778 million Euros and was purchased by an Asian investor. Christie’s auctioned the piece “Blue Rain” for 650.000 Euros and Sotheby’s once again sold “Duchamp’s Funeral” for 1.285.300 Euros. These figures confirm the success that the Romanian painter has been enjoying, especially abroad. But Ghenie says that he does not take any of his good fortune for granted, especially since he was raised to always expect the worse and to consider the good as some strange exception.

Ghenie intensifies the raw scream of Francis Bacon’s paintings to an even greater pitch, revisiting the Holocaust (as in one famous painting of Josef Mengele) and extending Bacon’s idiom of existential horror vividly into the present. Last year, his work featured in several museum exhibitions, including his first solo U.S. museum show at the MCA Denver and SFMoMA’s seminal group exhibition Six Lines of Flight . In March 2013, Pace Gallery presented his critically acclaimed New York debut. While Ghenie continues to explore the darker moments in European history, social and political abuses of power, as well as his personal history, his compositions have become conspicuously more complex over the years, as he has turned increasingly toward a brighter and more colorful palette, confidently shifting between figuration and abstraction. This book unites 80 of Ghenie’s key works from the past four years.\n Previous page Print length 184 pages.\nLanguage English.\nPublisher Hatje Cantz.\nPublication date June 30, 2014.\nDimensions 10.83 x 0.98 x 11.22 inches.\nISBN-10 3775736743.\nISBN-13 978-3775736749.\nSee all details.\nNext page.\nhtml Previous page Adrian Ghenie: Paintings 2014-2019 Jürg Judin 4.8 out of 5 stars  19.\nHardcover $41.42 $ 41 .\n 42.\n.\n$24.81 shipping.\nAdrian Ghenie: The Hooligans Apsara Diquinzio Hardcover $34.98 $ 34 .\n 98.\n.\n$19.30 shipping.\nAdrian Ghenie: I Have Turned My Only Face...

{"id": 21, "data": "Adrian Gheni graduated in 2001 from the University of Art and Design, Cluj, taught by Ioan Sbârciu. The works of this young Romanian painter are multi-layered, cinematic pieces that illustrate the effects of a dictatorship. These mnemonic images emerge from personal recollection as well as from historical archives, literature, social media and film. His findings are collaged and stencilled over; dripping and pouring the paint, scraping with palette knives. Drawing comparisons with the work of Francis Bacon, these figures reveal their suffering, rendered cruelly disfigured, distorted, decaying.  In 2005, Ghenie co-founded Galeria Plan B, a production and exhibition space for contemporary art. He has been the subject of solo exhibitions at museums including the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver (2012–2013); Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kuns (S.M.A.K.), Ghent (2010–2011); and National Museum of Contemporary Art, Bucharest (2009–2010). His work has been included in exhibitions at the Palazzo Grassi, François Pinault Foundation, Venice; Tate Liverpool; Prague Biennial; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi, Florence, among others.  He lives and works in Cluj and Berlin.\n Paintings \n", "label": [[0, 12, "ARTIST"], [26, 30, "DATE"], [70, 74, "GPE"], [498, 511, "ARTIST"], [605, 609, "DATE"], [611, 617, "ARTIST"], [629, 643, "GALLERY"], [770, 803, "MUSEUM"], [805, 814, "DATE"], [817, 862, "MUSEUM"], [864, 869, "GPE"], [871, 880, "DATE"], [887, 922, "MUSEUM"], [924, 933, "GPE"], [935, 944, "DATE"], [996, 1010, "MUSEUM"], [1012, 1039, "GALLERY"], [1041, 1047, "GPE"], [1049, 1053, "GALLERY"], [1054, 1063, "GPE"], [1065, 1080, "EVENT"], [1082, 1116, "MUSEUM"], [1122, 1148, "GALLERY"], [1150, 1158, "GPE"], [1197, 1201, "GPE"], [1206, 1212, "GPE"]]}
{"id": 22, "data": "Ghent Adrian Ghenie, Dada Room, 2010, mixed media. Installation view. Adrian Ghenie Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (SMAK)  Adrian Ghenie, Dada Room , 2010,.\nmixed media. Installation view.\n The absurdities and coincidences of childhood can shape your viewpoint for life. Growing up in Cluj, Romania, Adrian Ghenie was taught to worship the father of the state, Nicolae Ceauşescu. At the age of twelve, Ghenie lived through the “trial” and execution of the man whose photograph hung in every schoola sudden shock that turned the world as he knew it upside down. Meanwhile, his real father worshipped someone totally different. Playing in a rock ’n’ roll band, dressed up as Elvis, Ghenie Sr. paid tribute to the first global pop icon. The First International Dada Fair took place in 1920 in a room at a private house in Berlin. Ninety years later, Ghenie showed his own version, Dada Room, 2010. At first sight the darkened space, lit only by a single neon tube, looked shabby, even a bit filthy, but little by little the displayed artifacts, sketches, paintings, and a dummy revealed the painter’s obsessions, motives, and subjects. Historical references to the Dada era, World War II, and the cold war were mixed with personal memories. The walls were used as canvases or sketchbooks and covered with thick layers of paint in the somber coloration we know from Ghenie’s paintings. This installation served as an introduction to, or synthesis of, the paintings in the rest of the exhibition. Thus the German shepherd depicted in the installation returned in several more paintings. The reference to the cold war and America’s nuclear bomb tests in the Nevada desert became a powerful image in Self-Portrait as a Monkey, 2010, in which we see a nuclear blast behind the artist, seated in a chair, or Blow, 2010, which shows what might be a surreal image of a camera in some kind of desert storm but turns out to be a reflection on an event that really happened: In the late 1950s, a settlement complete with houses and other structures was built by the American government, and an atom bomb was dropped on it and filmedall to see what the result would be if an average town were destroyed by the Russians. Ghenie’s representation of this scene makes it seem iconic, yet also absurd. In That Moment, 2007, Ghenie shows us an image that doesn’t exist but which we might want to see: the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun after their suicide in the macabre setting of their bunker, which also contains an Arno Breker sculpture. That Moment offers a way to visualize an event that lacks an image in our collective memory. A more explicit personal comment on the Nazi period is conveyed in the shady psychoanalytical image The Nightmare, 2007. Here Ghenie imagines himself visited by Hitler, who watches over the sleeping artist, accompanied by two giant Alsatians. The tableau’s ominous colors strengthen the overwhelming feeling of approaching danger. Besides a couple of other more tongue-in-cheek paintings in which Marcel Duchamp or Ghenie Sr. and Elvis Presley play an important part, the show evoked an overall uncanny feeling that was perhaps best expressed by one of the smallest paintings in the exhibition, Untitled, 2007, in which a set of false teeth sits on a shelf. The exquisite yet gloomy way the teeth are painted sums up Ghenie’s dark viewpoint in the subtlest possible way. Jos Van den Bergh \n", "label": [[6, 19, "ARTIST"], [21, 30, "WORK_OF_ART"], [32, 36, "DATE"], [70, 83, "ARTIST"], [84, 126, "MUSEUM"], [128, 141, "ARTIST"], [143, 152, "WORK_OF_ART"], [155, 159, "DATE"], [290, 303, "GPE"], [305, 318, "ARTIST"], [407, 413, "ARTIST"], [686, 692, "ARTIST"], [744, 773, "EVENT"], [788, 792, "DATE"], [825, 831, "GPE"], [833, 845, "DATE"], [853, 859, "ARTIST"], [884, 893, "WORK_OF_ART"], [895, 899, "DATE"], [1368, 1375, "ARTIST"], [1622, 1629, "GPE"], [1658, 1664, "GPE"], [1699, 1724, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1726, 1730, "DATE"], [1805, 1809, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1811, 1815, "DATE"], [1979, 1984, "DATE"], [2212, 2219, "ARTIST"], [2292, 2303, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2305, 2309, "DATE"], [2311, 2317, "ARTIST"], [2505, 2516, "ARTIST"], [2528, 2539, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2721, 2734, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2736, 2740, "DATE"], [2747, 2753, "ARTIST"], [3018, 3032, "ARTIST"], [3036, 3042, "ARTIST"], [3051, 3064, "ARTIST"], [3216, 3224, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3226, 3230, "DATE"], [3338, 3345, "ARTIST"]]}

{"id": 24, "data": "Adrian Ghenie Adrian Ghenie was born in 1970 in Baia Mare, Romania, where he studied art and design at the University of Cluj. He currently lives and works in London. His work takes the form primarily of painting, and is updated daily with facts, people and events from the media. Genie combines these events with historical or literary episodes, which he revives in his paintings through juxtapositions that are often strident. The result is a series of portraits that sit midway between figuration and abstraction, in which realism sits alongside an emphasis on brushstrokes and drips of paint; these formal elements seem to underline his dark and brutal themes of extremism, disillusionment and abuse of power. In 2015 Adrian Ghenie represented Romania in the 56th Venice Biennale. In the same year, there were exhibitions of his work at the Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris, The MAC, Belfast and Mihai Nicodim Gallery, Los Angeles. His work was shown at Palazzo Grassi in the exhibition ‘The World Belongs to You’ (2011-12).\n", "label": [[0, 13, "ARTIST"], [14, 27, "ARTIST"], [40, 44, "DATE"], [48, 66, "GPE"], [159, 165, "GPE"], [281, 286, "ARTIST"], [717, 721, "DATE"], [722, 735, "ARTIST"], [748, 755, "GPE"], [763, 783, "EVENT"], [845, 868, "GALLERY"], [870, 875, "GPE"], [886, 893, "GPE"], [898, 919, "GALLERY"], [921, 932, "GPE"], [956, 970, "MUSEUM"], [990, 1014, "EVENT"], [1017, 1024, "DATE"]]}

Adrian Ghenie:\nPie-fights and Pathos September 21, 2012–January 13, 2013.\nText Adrian Ghenie: Pie-fights and Pathos presented a selection of work by the Romanian painter. Ghenie draws from Old Masters paintings, the history of cinema, and political extremism to create work that dwells on the dark underside of modernism. His paintings highlight forgotten episodes of history, shifting between abstraction and figuration. Like a memory, his work moves between fact and fiction, blurring the boundaries between the two. For this exhibition, Ghenie presented a new series of works alongside examples of earlier projects, offering a comprehensive review of the artist’s oeuvre, much of which has never been shown in this country. Adrian Ghenie was born in 1977 in Baia Mare, Romania. He graduated from the University of Art and Design, Cluj, Romania in 2001. His work has been exhibited at the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kuns, Ghent; National Museum of Contemporary Art, Bucharest; Palazzo Grassi, François Pinault Foundation, Venice; Tate Liverpool, United Kingdom; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi, Florence, among others.

All produced within the last year, the show draws on Ghenie’s continued interest and exploration of abstraction and its history, pulling in particular here from the work of  J.M.W. Turner, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin. Radicals in their time, their work unsettled artistic conventions, and here are treated as such in Ghenie’s equally visceral style. Adrian Ghenie, The Impressionists (2020), via Pace  This new body of work continues Ghenie’s exploration of abstract figures, layered shapes, and gestural painting techniques to create complex images intertwined with art historical narratives. Ghenie’s meditation on the idea of hooliganism, examining the role of rebellion in the artistic process, is applied here towards an excavation of art history and European history in tandem, long a hallmark of the artist’s work.   Somber and gritty, his canvases feature gestural, abstract brushstrokes that build on their roughshod application and clumpy application to create a wild gestural mass, here twisted in portraits and representations of the aforementioned figures, or turned them into references of their works. Adrian Ghenie, The Haystack (2020), via Pace Adrian Ghenie, The Hooligans (Installation View), via Pace Ghenie sees these artists as active disruptors in the flow and continuation of academic painting, affirming the materiality of oil paints with their loose brushstrokes, while amplifying painting’s optical qualities.  Paint in these artists works was equally a sensuous experience of the material and an expression of the self, realized through the images these artists depicted.  Here, Ghenie turns that notion on its ear, bringing these artists’ visages to the forefront with the same visceral energy their work expressed, that same sense of immersive luminosity and chromatic richness. new optical instruments and scientific experiments had already initiated. Ghenie, whose past work has explored the relationship between painting and cinema, continues to mine art’s ever-evolving relationship to history, vision, and technology, as suggested by the presence of anachronistic details, such as sneakers and baseball caps, VR goggles and security cameras, that interrupt broad sections drawn from familiar nineteenth-century paintings. The show, an expressive and intuitive investigation of the meaning and drive of these artists, closes February 27th. – J.

Beijing 2003[edit] 2003, Video, 150 hours Beginning under the Dabeiyao highway interchange, the vehicle from which Beijing 2003 was shot traveled every road within the Fourth Ring Road of Beijing and documented the road conditions. Approximately 2400 kilometers and 150 hours of footage later, it ended where it began under the Dabeiyao highway interchange. The documentation of these winding alleyways of the city center – now largely torn down for redevelopment – preserved a visual record of the city that is free of aesthetic judgment. Chang'an Boulevard[edit] 2004, Video, 10h 13m Moving from east to west, Chang'an Boulevard traverses Beijing's most iconic avenue. Along the boulevard's 45-kilometer length, it recorded the changing densities of its far-flung suburbs, central business districts, and political core. At each 50-meter increment, the artist records a single frame for one minute. The work reveals the rhythm of Beijing as a capital city, its social structure, cityscape, socialist-planned economy, capitalist market, political power center, commercial buildings, and industrial units as pieces of a multi-layered urban collage. Beijing: The Second Ring[edit] 2005, Video, 1h 6m Beijing: The Third Ring[edit] 2005 Video, 1h 50m Beijing: The Second Ring and Beijing: The Third Ring capture two opposite views of traffic flow on every bridge of each Ring Road, the innermost arterial highways of Beijing. The artist records a single frame for one minute for each view on the bridge. Beijing: The Second Ring was entirely shot on cloudy days, while the segments for Beijing: The Third Ring were entirely shot on sunny days. The films document the historic aspects and modern development of a city with a population of nearly 11 million people. Fairytale[edit] 2007, video, 2h 32m[1] Fairytale covers Ai Weiwei's project Fairytale, part of Europe's most innovative five-year art event Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany in 2007. Ai invited 1001 Chinese citizens of different ages and from various backgrounds to travel to Kassel, Germany to experience a fairytale of their own.[2]\nThe 152-minute long film documents the ideation and process of staging Fairytale and covering project preparations, participants' challenges, and travel to Germany. Along with this documentary, Fairytale was documented through written materials and photographs of participants and artifacts from the event.[3] Fairytale was an act of social subversion, improving relationships between China and the West through interactions among participants and the citizens of Kassel. Ai Weiwei felt that he was able to make a positive influence on both participants of Fairytale and Kassel citizens.[3] Little Girl's Cheeks[edit] 2008, video, 1h 18m[4] On 15 December 2008, a citizens' investigation began with the goal of seeking an explanation for the casualties of the Sichuan earthquake that happened on 12 May 2008. The investigation covered 14 counties and 74 townships within the disaster zone, and studied the conditions of 153 schools that were affected by the earthquake.\nBy gathering and confirming comprehensive details about the students, such as their age, region, school, and grade, the group managed to affirm that there were 5,192 students who perished in the disaster.\nAmong a hundred volunteers, 38 of them participated in fieldwork, with 25 of them being controlled by the Sichuan police for a total of 45 times.\nThis documentary is a structural element of the citizens' investigation. 4851[edit] 2009, looped video, 1h 27m[5] At 14:28 on 12 May 2008, an 8.0-magnitude earthquake happened in Sichuan, China. Over 5,000 students in primary and secondary schools perished in the earthquake, yet their names went unannounced. In reaction to the government's lack of transparency, a citizen's investigation was initiated to find out their names and details about their schools and families.\nAs of 2 September 2009, there were 4,851 confirmed. This video is a tribute to these perished students and a memorial for innocent lives lost. A Beautiful Life[edit] 2009, video, 48m[6] This video documents the story of Chinese citizen Feng Zhenghu and his struggles to return home.\nThe Shanghai authorities rejected Feng Zhenghu, originated from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China, from returning to the country for a total of eight times in 2009. On 4 November 2009, Feng Zhenghu attempted to return home for the ninth time but the police from Shanghai used violence and kidnapped him to board a flight to Japan. Feng refused to enter Japan and decided to live in the Immigration Hall at Terminal 1 of the Narita Airport in Tokyo, as an act of protest.\nHe relied on food gifts from tourists for sustenance and lived at a passageway in the Narita Airport for 92 days. He posted updates over Twitter, they attracted much concern and led to wide media coverage from Chinese netizens and international communities.\nOn 31 January, Feng announced an end to his protest at the Narita Airport. On 12 February, Feng was allowed entry to China, where he reunited with his family at home in Shanghai.\nAi Weiwei and his assistant Gao Yuan, went from Beijing to interview Feng Zhenghu three times at the Narita Airport of Japan on 16 November 20 November 2009 and 31 January 2010, and documented his life at the airport passageway and the entire process of his return to China. Disturbing the Peace (Laoma Tihua)[edit] 2009, video, 1h 19m[7] Ai Weiwei studio production Laoma Tihua is a documentary of an incident during Tan Zuoren's trial on 12 August 2009. Tan Zuoren was charged with \"inciting subversion of state power\". Chengdu police detained witnessed during the trial of the civil rights advocate, which is an obstruction of justice and violence.\nTan Zuoren was charged as a result of his research and questioning regarding the 5.12 Wenchuan students' casualties and the corruption resulting poor building construction. Tan Zuoren was sentenced to five years of prison. One Recluse[edit] 2010, video, 3h[8] In June 2008, Yang Jia carried a knife, a hammer, a gas mask, pepper spray, gloves and Molotov cocktails to the Zhabei Public Security Branch Bureau and killed six police officers, injuring another police officer and a guard. He was arrested on the scene, and was subsequently charged with intentional homicide. In the following six months, while Yang Jia was detained and trials were held, his mother has mysteriously disappeared.\nThis video is a documentary that traces the reasons and motivations behind the tragedy and investigates into a trial process filled with shady cover-ups and questionable decisions. The film provides a glimpse into the realities of a government-controlled judicial system and its impact on the citizens' lives. Hua Hao Yue Yuan[edit] 2010, video, 2h 6m[9] “The future dictionary definition of 'crackdown' will be: First cover one’s head up firmly, and then beat him or her up violently.” – @aiww\nIn the summer of 2010, the Chinese government began a crackdown on dissent, and Hua Hao Yue Yuan documents the stories of Liu Dejun and Liu Shasha, whose activism and outspoken attitude led them to violent abuse from the authorities. On separate occasions, they were kidnapped, beaten and thrown into remote locations. The incidents attracted much concern over the Internet, as well as wide speculation and theories about what exactly happened. This documentary presents interviews of the two victims, witnesses and concerned netizens. In which it gathers various perspectives about the two beatings, and brings us closer to the brutal reality of China's “crackdown on crime”. Remembrance[edit] 2010, voice recording, 3h 41m[10] On 24 April 2010 at 00:51, Ai Weiwei (@aiww) started a Twitter campaign to commemorate students who perished in the earthquake in Sichuan on 12 May 2008. 3,444 friends from the Internet delivered voice recordings, the names of 5,205 perished were recited 12,140 times.\nRemembrance is an audio work dedicated to the young people who lost their lives in the Sichuan earthquake. It expresses thoughts for the passing of innocent lives and indignation for the cover-ups on truths about sub-standard architecture, which led to the large number of schools that collapsed during the earthquake. San Hua[edit] 2010, video, 1h 8m[11] The shooting and editing of this video lasted nearly seven months at the Ai Weiwei studio. It began near the end of 2007 in an interception organized by cat-saving volunteers in Tianjin, and the film locations included Tianjin, Shanghai, Rugao of Jiangsu, Chaoshan of Guangzhou, and Hebei Province. The documentary depicts a complete picture of a chain in the cat-trading industry.\nSince the end of 2009 when the government began soliciting expert opinion for the Animal Protection Act, the focus of public debate has always been on whether one should be eating cats or not, or whether cat-eating is a Chinese tradition or not. There are even people who would go as far as to say that the call to stop eating cat meat is \"imposing the will of the minority on the majority\". Yet the \"majority\" does not understand the complete truth of cat-meat trading chains: cat theft, cat trafficking, killing cats, selling cats, and eating cats, all the various stages of the trade and how they are distributed across the country, in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Rugao, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Hebei. This well-organized, smooth-running industry chain of cat abuse, cat killing and skinning has already existed among ordinary Chinese folks for 20 years, or perhaps even longer.\nThe degree of civilization of a country can be seen from its attitude towards animals. Ordos 100[edit] 2011, video, 1h 1m[12] This documentary is about the construction project curated by Herzog & de Meuron and Ai Weiwei. One hundred architects from 27 countries were chosen to participate and design a 1000 square meter villa to be built in a new community in Inner Mongolia. The 100 villas would be designed to fit a master plan designed by Ai Weiwei.\nOn 25 January 2008, the 100 architects gathered in Ordos for a first site visit. The film Ordos 100 documents the total of three site visits to Ordos, during which time the master plan and design of each villa was completed. As of 2016, the Ordos 100 project remains unrealized. So Sorry[edit] 2011, video, 54m[13] As a sequel to Ai Weiwei's film Lao Ma Ti Hua, the film So Sorry (named after the artist's 2009 exhibition in Munich, Germany) shows the beginnings of the tension between Ai Weiwei and the Chinese Government. In Lao Ma Ti Hua, Ai Weiwei travels to Chengdu, Sichuan to attend the trial of the civil rights advocate Tan Zuoren, as a witness. So Sorry shows the investigation led by Ai Weiwei studio to identify the students who died during the Sichuan earthquake as a result of corruption and poor building constructions leading to the confrontation between Ai Weiwei and the Chengdu police. After being beaten by the police, Ai Weiwei traveled to Munich, Germany to prepare his exhibition at the museum Haus der Kunst. The result of his beating led to intense headaches caused by a brain hemorrhage and was treated by emergency surgery. These events mark the beginning of Ai Weiwei's struggle and surveillance at the hands of the state police. Ping'an Yueqing[edit] 2011, video, 2h 22m[14] This documentary investigates the death of popular Zhaiqiao village leader Qian Yunhui in the fishing village of Yueqing, Zhejiang province. When the local government confiscated marshlands in order to convert them into construction land, the villagers were deprived of the opportunity to cultivate these lands and be fully self-subsistent. Qian Yunhui, unafraid of speaking up for his villagers, travelled to Beijing several times to report this injustice to the central government. In order to silence him, he was detained by local government repeatedly. On 25 December 2010, Qian Yunhui was hit by a truck and died on the scene. News of the incident and photos of the scene quickly spread over the internet. The local government claimed that Qian Yunhui was the victim of an ordinary traffic accident. This film is an investigation conducted by Ai Weiwei studio into the circumstances of the incident and its connection to the land dispute case, mainly based on interviews of family members, villagers and officials. It is an attempt by Ai Weiwei to establish the facts and find out what really happened on 25 December 2010.\nDuring shooting and production, Ai Weiwei studio experienced significant obstruction and resistance from local government. The film crew was followed, sometimes physically stopped from shooting certain scenes and there were even attempts to buy off footage. All villagers interviewed for the purposes of this documentary have been interrogated or illegally detained by local government to some extent. The Crab House[edit] 2011, video, 1h 1m[15] Early in 2008, the district government of Jiading, Shanghai invited Ai Weiwei to build a studio in Malu Township, as a part of the local government's efforts in developing its cultural assets. By August 2010, the Ai Weiwei Shanghai Studio completed all of its construction work. In October 2010, the Shanghai government declared the Ai Weiwei Shanghai Studio an illegal construction, and was subjected to demolition. On 7 November 2010, when Ai Weiwei was placed under house arrest by public security in Beijing, over 1,000 netizens attended the \"River Crab Feast\" at the Shanghai Studio.\nOn 11 January 2011, the Shanghai city government forcibly demolished the Ai Weiwei Studio within a day, without any prior notice. Stay Home[edit] 2013, video, 1h 17m[16] This video tells the story of Liu Ximei, who at her birth in 1985 was given to relatives to be raised because she was born in violation of China's strict one-child policy. When she was ten years old, Liu was severely injured while working in the fields and lost large amounts of blood. While undergoing treatment at a local hospital, she was given a blood transfusion that was later revealed to be contaminated with HIV. Following this exposure to the virus, Liu contracted AIDS. According to official statistics, in 2001 there were 850,000 AIDS sufferers in China, many of whom contracted the illness in the 1980s and 1990s as the result of a widespread plasma market operating in rural, impoverished areas and using unsafe collection methods. Ai Weiwei's Appeal ¥15,220,910.50[edit] 2014, video, 2h 8m[17] Ai Weiwei's Appeal ¥15,220,910.50 opens with Ai Weiwei's mother at the Venice Biennial in the summer of 2013 examining Ai's large S.A.C.R.E.D. installation portraying his 81-day imprisonment. The documentary goes onto chronologically reconstruct the events that occurred from the time he was arrested at the Beijing airport in April 2011 to his final court appeal in September 2012. The film portrays the day-to-day activity surrounding Ai Weiwei, his family and his associates ranging from consistent visits by the authorities, interviews with reporters, support and donations from fans, and court dates.\nThe Film premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam on 23 January 2014. Fukushima Art Project[edit] 2015, video, 30m[18] This documentary on the Fukushima Art Project is about artist Ai Weiwei's investigation of the site as well as the project's installation process.\nIn August 2014, Ai Weiwei was invited as one of the participating artists for the Fukushima Nuclear Zone by the Japanese art coalition Chim↑Pom, as part of the project Don't Follow the Wind . Ai accepted the invitation and sent his assistant Ma Yan to the exclusion zone in Japan to investigate the site.\nThe Fukushima Nuclear Exclusion Zone is thus far located within the 20-kilometer radius of land area of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. 25,000 people have already been evacuated from the Exclusion Zone. Both water and electric circuits were cut off. Entrance restriction is expected to be relieved in the next thirty years, or even longer. The art project will also be open to public at that time. The three spots usable as exhibition spaces by the artists are all former residential houses, among which exhibition site one and two were used for working and lodging; and exhibition site three was used as a community entertainment facility with an ostrich farm.\nAi brought about two projects, A Ray of Hope and Family Album after analyzing materials and information generated from the site.\nIn A Ray of Hope, a solar photovoltaic system is built on exhibition site one, on the second level of the old warehouse. Integral LED lighting devices are used in the two rooms. The lights would turn on automatically from 7 to 10 pm, and from 6 to 8 am daily. This lighting system is the only light source in the Exclusion Zone after this project was installed.\nPhotos of Ai and his studio staff at Caochangdi that make up project Family Album are displayed on exhibition site two and three, in the seven rooms where locals used to live. The twenty-two selected photos are divided in five categories according to types of event spanning eight years. Among these photos, six of them were taken from the site investigation at the 2008 Sichuan earthquake; two were taken during the time when he was illegally detained after pleading the Tan Zuoren case in Chengdu, China in August 2009; and three others taken during his surgical treatment for his head injury from being attacked in the head by police officers in Chengdu; five taken of him being followed by the police and his Beijing studio Fake Design under surveillance due to the studio tax case from 2011 to 2012; four are photos of Ai Weiwei and his family from year 2011 to year 2013; and the other two were taken earlier of him in his studio in Caochangdi (One taken in 2005 and the other in 2006). Human Flow[edit] Main article: Human Flow.\nA feature-length documentary directed by Weiwei and co-produced by Andy Cohen about the global refugee crisis.[19] Coronation[edit] Main article: Coronation (2020 film).\nA feature-length documentary directed by Weiwei about happenings in Wuhan, China during the global COVID-19 pandemic.[20][21] Visual arts[edit] Sunflower Seeds , 2010.\nTrees , 2010.\nDog's head sculpture, Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads , 2011.\nF Grass , 2014.\nForever , 2018, Artz Pedregal , Mexico City.\nAi's visual art includes sculptural installations, woodworking, video and photography.  \"Ai Weiwei: According to What,\" adapted and expanded by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden from a 2009 exhibition at Tokyo's Mori Art Museum, was Ai's first North American museum retrospective.\n[22]\nIt opened at the Hirshhorn in Washington, D.C. in 2013, and subsequently traveled to the Brooklyn Museum, New York,\n[23]\nand two other venues. His works address his investigation into the aftermath of the Sichuan earthquake and responses to the Chinese government's detention and surveillance of him.\n[24]\nHis recent public pieces have called attention to the Syrian refugee crisis.[25] Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn[edit] (1995) Performance in which Ai lets an ancient ceramic urn fall from his hands and smash to pieces on the ground. The performance was memorialized in a series of three photographic still frames.[26] Map of China[edit] (2008) Sculpture resembling a park bench or tree trunk, but its cross-section is a map of China. It is four metres long and weighs 635 kilograms. It is made from wood salvaged from Qing Dynasty temples.[27] Table with two legs on the wall[edit] (2008) Ming dynasty table cut in half and rejoined at a right angle to rest two feet on the wall and two on the floor. The reconstruction was completed using Chinese period specific joinery techniques.[28] Straight[edit] (2008–2012) 150 tons of twisted steel reinforcements recovered from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake building collapse sites were straightened out and displayed as an installation.[29] Sunflower Seeds[edit] (2010) Opening in October 2010 at the Tate Museum in London, Ai displayed 100 million handmade and painted porcelain sunflower seeds. The work as installed was called 1-125,000,000 and subsequent installations have been titled Sunflower Seeds. The initial installation had the seeds spread across the floor of the Turbine Hall in a thin 10 cm layer.[30] The seeds weigh about 10 metric tonnes and were made by artisans over two and a half years by 1,600 Jingdezhen artisans in a city where porcelain had been made for Chinese rulers and court for over one thousand years. Made by the traditional method for which the city is known, a thirty-stage process was employed. The sculpture refers to chairman Mao's rule and the Chinese Communist Party. The mass of tiny seeds represents that, together, the people of China can stand up and overthrow the Chinese Communist Party. The seeds also refer to China's current mass-automated production based on Western-style consumerist culture. The sculpture challenges the \"Made in China\" mantra, memorialising labour-intensive traditional methods of craft objects.[31] Surveillance Camera[edit] (2010) Sculptures in marble to resemble the cameras placed in front of Ai's studio.[32] Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads[edit] (2011) Sculptures of zodiac animals inspired by the water clock-fountain at the Old Summer Palace.[33] Coca Cola Vase[edit] (2014) Han dynasty vase with the Coca-Cola logo brushed on in red acrylic paint.[34] Grapes[edit] (2014) 32 Qing dynasty stools joined together in a cluster with legs pointing out.[35] Free-speech Puzzle[edit] (2014) Individual porcelain ornaments, each painted with characters for \"free speech\", which when set together form a map of China.[36] Trace[edit] (2014) Consisting of 176 2D-portraits in Lego which are set onto a large floor space, Trace was commissioned by the FOR-SITE Foundation, the United States National Park Service and the Golden Gate Park Conservancy.  The original installation was at Alcatraz Prison in San Francisco Bay; the 176 portraits being of various political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.  After seeing one million visitors during its one-year display at Alcatraz, the installation was moved and put on display at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. (in a modified form; the pieces had to be arranged to fit the circular floor space).  The display at the Hirshhorn ran from 28 June 2017 – 1 January 2018.  The display also included two versions of his wallpaper work The Animal That Looks Like a Llama but Is Really an Alpaca and a video running on a loop.[37] Law of the Journey[edit] (2017) As the culmination of Ai's experiences visiting 40 refugee camps in 2016, Law of the Journey featured an all-black, 230-foot-long (70 m) inflatable boat carrying 258 faceless refugee figures. The art piece is currently on display at the National Gallery in Prague until 7 January 2018.[38] Two Iron Trees at The Shrine of Book[edit] (2017) Permanent exhibit, unique setting of two Iron Trees from now on frame the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem, Israel where Dead Sea Scrolls are preserved.[39][40] Journey of Laziz[edit] (2017) The exhibition was on the view in the Israel Museum until the end of October 2017. Journey of Laziz is a video installation, showing mental breakdown and overall suffering of tiger living in the \"world's worst ZOO\" in Gaza.[39][40] Hansel and Gretel[edit] (2017) The exhibition at the Park Avenue Armory from 7 June- 6 August 2017, Hansel and Gretel was an installation exploring the theme of surveillance. The project, a collaboration of Ai Weiwei and architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, features surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition software, near-infrared floor projections, tethered, autonomous drones and sonar beacons. A companion website includes a curatorial statement, artist biographies, a livestream of the installation and a timeline of surveillance technology from ancient to modern times.[41] The Animal That Looks Like a Llama but Is Really an Alpaca[edit] (2017) The Animal That Looks Like a Llama but Is Really an Alpaca, and its companion piece The Plain Version of The Animal That Looks Like a Llama but Is Really an Alpaca, is a wallpaper work consisting of intricate tiled patterns showing various pieces of surveillance equipment in whimsical arrangements.  The two pieces were installed at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., as part of a full-floor exhibition of his work that also included a video and the 2014 installation Trace.[37] man in a cube[edit] (2017) Ai Weiwei created the sculpture man in a cube for the exhibition Luther and the Avantgarde in Wittenberg to mark the 2017 quincentenary of the Reformation. In it, the artist worked through his experiences of anxiety and isolation following his arrest by Chinese authorities: “My work is physically a concrete block, which contains within it a single figure in solitude. That figure is the likeness of myself during my eighty-one days under secret detention in 2011.”[42] Concentrating on ideas and language helped Ai Weiwei endure his imprisonment. He was also intrigued by the connectedness of freedom, language and ideas in Martin Luther, to whom he explicitly paid tribute with man in a cube.\nOnce the exhibition in Wittenberg closed, the Stiftung Lutherhaus Eisenach endeavored to make this exceptional manifestation of contemporary Reformation commemoration, man in a cube, permanently accessible to a wide audience. Thanks to the generous support of numerous backers, the museum managed to acquire the sculpture in 2019. It was erected in the courtyard of the Lutherhaus and presented to the public in a ceremony the following year, the five hundredth anniversary of the publication of Martin Luther's treatise On the Freedom of a Christian.[43] Good Fences Make Good Neighbors[edit] Ai Weiwei's 2017–18 New York City-wide public art exhibition. Forever Bicycles[edit] Forever Bicycles is a 32-foot (9.8 m) sculpture of 1,300 bicycles in Austin, Texas, which was installed in 2017.[44] Forever[edit] A sculpture of many bicycles is displayed as public art in the gardens of the Artz Pedregal shopping mall in Mexico City since its opening in March 2018. Priceless[edit] A collaboration with conceptual artist Kevin Abosch primarily made up of two standard ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, called PRICELESS (PRCLS is its symbol). One of these tokens is forever unavailable to anyone, but the other is meant for distribution and is divisible up to 18 decimal places, meaning it can be given away one quintillionth at a time. A nominal amount of the distributable token was “burned” (put into digital wallets with the keys thrown away), and these wallet addresses were printed on paper and sold to art buyers in a series of 12 physical works. Each wallet address alphanumeric is a proxy for a shared moment between Abosch and Ai.[45] Architecture[edit] Ai Weiwei is also a notable architect known for his collaborations with Herzog & de Meuron and Wang Shu. In 2005, Ai was invited by Wang Shu as an external teacher of the Architecture Department of China Academy of Art.[46] Jinhua Park[edit] \" Archaeological Archives \" designed by Ai Weiwei inside the Jinhua Architecture Park .\n In 2002, he was the curator of the project Jinhua Architecture Park. Tsai Residence[edit] In 2006, Ai and HHF Architects designed a private residence in upstate New York.[47] According to The New York Times, the Tsai Residence is divided into four modules and the details are \"extraordinarily refined\".[47][48] In 2009, the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design selected the home for its International Architecture Awards, one of the world's most prestigious global awards for new architecture, landscape architecture, interiors and urban planning.[49] In 2010, Wallpaper magazine nominated the residence for its Wallpaper Design Awards category: Best New Private House.[50] A detached guesthouse, also designed by Ai and HHF Architects, was completed after the main house and, according to New York Magazine, looks like a \"floating boomerang of rusty Cor-Ten steel.\"[51] Ordos 100[edit] In 2008, Ai curated the architecture project Ordos 100 in Ordos City, Inner Mongolia. He invited 100 architects from 29 countries to participate in this project.[52] Beijing National Stadium[edit] The Beijing National Stadium at night during the 2008 Summer Olympics Ai was commissioned as the artistic consultant for design, collaborating with the Swiss firm Herzog & de Meuron, for the Beijing National Stadium for the 2008 Summer Olympics, also known as the \"Bird's Nest.\"[53] Although ignored by the Chinese media, he had voiced his anti-Olympics views.[54] He later distanced himself from the project, saying, \"I've already forgotten about it. I turn down all the demands to have photographs with it,\" saying it is part of a \"pretend smile\" of bad taste.[55][56] In August 2007, he also accused those choreographing the Olympic opening ceremony, including Steven Spielberg and Zhang Yimou, of failing to live up to their responsibility as artists. Ai said \"It's disgusting. I don't like anyone who shamelessly abuses their profession, who makes no moral judgment.\"[57] In February 2008, Spielberg withdrew from his role as advisor to the 2008 Summer Olympics.[58][59] When asked why he participated in the designing of the Bird's Nest in the first place, Ai replied \"I did it because I love design.\"[60] Serpentine Pavilion[edit] In summer 2012, Ai teamed again with Herzog & de Meuron on a \"would-be archaeological site [as] a game of make-believe and fleeting memory\" as the year's temporary Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London's Kensington Gardens.[61][62] Books[edit] Venice Elegy[edit] This edition of Yang Lian's poems and Ai Weiwei's visual images was realized by the publishing house Damocle Edizioni – Venice in 200 numbered copies on Fabriano Paper. The book was printed with the Printing Press at the Stamperia del Tintoretto di Venezia – Venice, May 2018. Every book is hand signed by Yang Lian and Ai Weiwei. Traces of Survival[edit] In December 2014 Ruya Foundation for Contemporary Culture in Iraq provided drawing materials to three refugee camps in Iraq: Camp Shariya, Camp Baharka and Mar Elia Camp. Ruya Foundation collected over 500 submissions.[63] A number of these images were then selected by Ai Weiwei for a major publication, Traces of Survival: Drawings by Refugees in Iraq selected by Ai Weiwei, that was published to coincide with the Iraq Pavilion at the 56th Venice Biennale. Music[edit] On 24 October 2012, Ai went live with a cover of Gangnam Style,[64] the famous K-pop phenomenon by South Korean rapper PSY, through the posting of a four-minute long parody video on YouTube. The video was an attempt to criticize the Chinese government's attempt to silence his activism and was quickly blocked by national authorities. On 22 May 2013, Ai debuted his first single Dumbass over the internet, with a music video shot by cinematographer Christopher Doyle. The video was a reconstruction of Ai's experience in prison, during his 81-day detention, and dives in and out of the prison's reality and the guarding soldiers' fantasies.[65] He later released a second single, Laoma Tihua, on 20 June 2013 along with a video on his experience of state surveillance, with footage compiled from his studio's documentaries.[66] On 22 June 2013, the two-year anniversary of Ai's release, he released his first music album The Divine Comedy.[67] Later in August, he released a third music video for the song Chaoyang Park, also included in the album.[68] Other engagements[edit] Ai is the Artistic Director of China Art Archives & Warehouse (CAAW), which he co-founded in 1997. This contemporary art archive and experimental gallery in Beijing concentrates on experimental art from the People's Republic of China, initiates and facilitates exhibitions and other forms of introductions inside and outside China.[69] The building which houses it was designed by Ai in 2000.[70] On 15 March 2010, Ai took part in Digital Activism in China, a discussion hosted by The Paley Media Center in New York with Jack Dorsey (founder of Twitter) and Richard MacManus.[71] Also in 2010 he served as jury member for Future Generation Art Prize, Kiev, Ukraine; contributed design for Comme de Garcons Aoyama Store, Tokyo, Japan; and participated in a talk with Nobel Prize winner Herta Müller at the International Culture festival Litcologne in Cologne, Germany. In 2011, Ai sat on the jury of an international initiative to find a universal Logo for Human Rights. The winning design, combining the silhouette of a hand with that of a bird, was chosen from more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries. The initiative's goal was to create an internationally recognized logo to support the global human rights movement.[98] In 2013, after the existence of the PRISM surveillance program was revealed, Ai said \"Even though we know governments do all kinds of things I was shocked by the information about the US surveillance operation, Prism. To me, it's abusively using government powers to interfere in individuals' privacy. This is an important moment for international society to reconsider and protect individual rights.\"[99] In 2012, Ai interviewed a member of the 50 Cent Party, a group of \"online commentators\" (otherwise known as sockpuppets) covertly hired by the Chinese government to post \"comments favourable towards party policies and [intending] to shape public opinion on internet message boards and forums\".[72] Keeping Ai's source anonymous, the transcript was published by the British magazine New Statesman on 17 October 2012, offering insights on the education, life, methods and tactics used by professional trolls serving pro-government interests. Ai designed the cover for 17 June 2013 issue of Time magazine. The cover story, by Hannah Beech, is \"How China Sees the World\".[73] TIME Magazine called it \"the most beautiful cover we've ever done in our history.\"[74] In 2011, Ai served as co-director and curator of the 2011 Gwangju Design Biennale, and co-curator of the exhibition Shanshui at The Museum of Art Lucerne.[75] Also in 2011, Ai spoke at TED (conference) and was a guest lecturer at Oslo School of Architecture and Design. In 2013, Ai became a Reporters Without Borders ambassador.[76] He also gave a hundred pictures to the NGO in order to release a Photo book and a digital album, both sold in order to fund freedom of information projects.[77][78] In 2014–2015, Ai explored human rights and freedom of expression through an exhibition of his art exclusively created for Alcatraz, a notorious federal penitentiary in San Francisco Bay. Ai's @Large exhibit raised questions and contradictions about human rights and the freedom of expression through his artwork at the island's layered legacy as a 19th-century military fortress.[79] Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei has used thousands of life jackets in two different installation to draw attention to refugees who have drowned while trying to reach Europe. In February 2016, Ai WeiWei attached 14,000 bright orange life jackets to the columns of the Konzerthaus in Berlin. The life jackets had been discarded by refugees arriving on the shore on the Greek island of Lesbos. Later that year, he installed a different piece, also using discarded life jackets, at the pond at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna. References[edit] ^ Fairytale 《童话》 . YouTube (18 December 2012).

His activity as a dissident has gone hand in hand with his artistic career and he has continued to produce work testifying to his political beliefs while at the same time making plenty of room for creativity and experimentation. His output over the past thirty years allows us to explore his ambivalent rapport both with Western culture and with the culture of his own country – torn between a deep-rooted sense of belonging and an equally strong urge to rebel. Ai Weiwei was born in 1957 in Beijing. His father, the poet Ai Qing, was labeled a “rightist” in 1958 and Ai and his family were exiled, first to Heilongjiang, in northeastern China, and then soon after to the deserts of Xinjiang, in northwestern China. Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, Ai Qing was rehabilitated and the family moved back to Beijing. Ai would enroll at the Beijing Film Academy and was one of the original members of the ‘Stars’ group of artists. Ai moved to the United States in 1981, living in New York between 1983 and 1993. He briefly studied at the Parsons School of Design. In New York, Ai would discover the works of Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol. Returning to China in 1993 to care for his ailing father, Ai contributed to the establishment of Beijing’s East Village, a community of avant-garde artists. In 1997, he co-founded the China Art Archives & Warehouse (CAAW), one of the first independent art spaces in China. He began to take an interest in architecture in 1999, designing his own studio house in Caochangdi, on the northeast edge of Beijing. In 2003, Ai started his own architecture practice, FAKE Design. In 2007, as a participant of documenta 12, Ai brought 1001 Chinese citizens to Kassel as part of his Fairytale project. In 2008, Ai and the Swiss architecture team of Herzog and de Meuron designed the Beijing National Stadium. In 2010, Ai covered the floor of the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern with 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds. In 2012, Ai Weiwei was awarded the Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent, by the Human Rights Foundation. In 2015, Ai was awarded the Ambassador of Conscience Award, by Amnesty International, for his actions in support of the defense of human rights. In 2017  his epic film journey 'Human Flow' took part in the 74th Venice International Film Festival. The film gives a powerful visual expression to the contemporary massive human migration. Captured over the course of an eventful year in 23 countries, 'Human Flow' follows a chain of urgent human stories that stretches across the globe in countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, France, Greece, Germany, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, and Turkey.\n Selected Solo Exhibitions 2019 RAIZ, CCBB, Belo Horizonte, BR Ai Weiwei: Unbroken, Gardiner Museum, Toronto, CA Resetting Memories, MUAC, Mexico City, MX RAIZ, Museu Oscar Niemeyer, Curitiba, BR Wo ist de Revolution?, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, DüsseldorfDE RAIZ, CCBB, Rio de Janeiro, BR Bare Life, Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, St. Louis, MO, USA Restablecer Memorias, MARCO, Monterrey, MX.\n2018 RAIZ, OCA, São Paulo, BR Ai Weiwei : Fan-Tan, Mucem, Marseille, FR   Inoculation, Corpartes, Santiago, CN Ai Weiwei: Life Cycle, Marciano Art Foundation, Los Angeles, US Ai Weiwei: Zodiac, Jeffrey Deitch, Los Angeles, US Laundromat, Garage Gallery, Fire Station, Doha, QA Cao / Humanity, UTA Artist Space, Beverly Hills, LA, US.\n2017 Inoculation, PROA, Buenos Aires, AR Ai Weiwei - Mirror, FOMU, Antwerp, BE Good Fences Make Good Neighbours, Public Art Fund NYC, New York, US Ai Weiwei on Porcelain, Sakip Sabanci Museum, Istanbul, TR Ai Weiwei: Trace at Hirshhorn, Hirshhorn Museum, Washington DC, US AI WEIWEI: SOLEIL LEVANT, Charlottenborg Kunsthal, Copenhagen, DK Ai Weiwei, The Contemporary Austin, Texas, US Maybe, Maybe Not, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, IL Odyssey, ZAC, Palermo, IT #AiWeiwei, Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago, US Mountains and Seas, Chateaux La Coste, Aix en Provence, FR Law of the Journey, National Gallery Prague, Prague, CZ   Ai Weiwei at Meijer Gardens: Natural State, Meijer Gardens, Grand Rapids, US.\n2016 Ai Weiwei at Meijer Gardens: Natural State, Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, Grand Rapids, MI, US Around Ai Weiwei.

{"id": 33, "data": "Stefen Chow / Novus Select Last year, the editors of ArtReview magazine named the Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei the most powerful artist in the world. It was an unusual choice. Ai’s varied, scattershot work doesn’t fetch the highest prices at auction, and critics, while they admire his achievement, don’t treat him as a master who has transformed the art of his period. In China, Ai—a brave and unrelenting critic of the authoritarian regime—has spent time in jail, was not allowed by the government to leave Beijing for a year and cannot travel without official permission. As a result, he has become a symbol of the struggle for human rights in China, but not preeminently so. He is too quixotic a figure to have developed the moral gravitas of the great men of conscience who challenged the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. So what is it about Ai? What makes him, in Western eyes, the world’s “most powerful artist”? The answer lies in the West itself. Now obsessed with China, the West would surely invent Ai if he didn’t already exist. China may after all become the most powerful nation in the world. It must therefore have an artist of comparable consequence to hold up a mirror both to China’s failings and its potential. Ai (his name is pronounced eye way-way) is perfect for the part. Having spent his formative years as an artist in New York in the 1980s, when Warhol was a god and conceptual and performance art were dominant, he knows how to combine his life and art into a daring and politically charged performance that helps define how we see modern China. He’ll use any medium or genre—sculpture, ready-mades, photography, performance, architecture, tweets and blogs—to deliver his pungent message. Ai’s persona—which, as with Warhol’s, is inseparable from his art—draws power from the contradictory roles that artists perform in modern culture. The loftiest are those of martyr, preacher and conscience. Not only has Ai been harassed and jailed, he has also continually called the Chinese regime to account; he has made a list, for example, that includes the name of each of the more than 5,000 schoolchildren who died during the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 because of shoddy schoolhouse construction. At the same time, he plays a decidedly unsaintly, Dada-inspired role—the bad boy provocateur who outrages stuffed shirts everywhere. (In one of his best-known photographs, he gives the White House the finger.) Not least, he is a kind of visionary showman. He cultivates the press, arouses comment and creates spectacles. His signature work, Sunflower Seeds—a work of hallucinatory intensity that was a sensation at the Tate Modern in London in 2010—consists of 100 million pieces of porcelain, each painted by one of 1,600 Chinese craftsmen to resemble a sunflower seed. As Andy would say, in high deadpan, “Wow.” This year Ai is the subject of two shows in Washington, D.C., an appropriate backdrop for an A-list power artist. In the spring, “Perspectives: Ai Weiwei” opened at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery with a monumental installation of Fragments (2005). Working with a team of skilled carpenters, Ai turned ironwood salvaged from dismantled Qing-era temples into a handsomely constructed structure that appears chaotic on the ground but, if seen from above, coalesces into a map of China. (Fragments embodies a dilemma characteristic of Ai: Can the timber of the past, foolishly discarded by the present, be recrafted into a China, perhaps a better China, that we cannot yet discern?) And the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden will present a wide-ranging survey of Ai’s work, from October 7 to February 2013. The exhibition title—“According to What?”—was borrowed from a Jasper Johns painting. The question that is not often asked is whether Ai, as an artist, is more than just a contemporary phenom. Is Sunflower Seeds, for example, more than a passing headline? Will Ai ultimately matter to China—and to the future—as much as he does to today’s Western art world? Ai lives in Caochangdi, a village in suburban Beijing favored by artists, where, like an art-king in exile, he regularly greets visitors come to pay homage to his vision of a better China. A large, burly man with a fondness for the neighborhood’s feral cats, Ai, who is 55, is disarmingly modest for one who spends so much time in the public eye. He recently told Christina Larson, an American writer in Beijing who interviewed the artist for Smithsonian, that he remains astonished by his prominence. “The secret police told me everybody can see it but you, that you’re so influential. But I think [their behavior] makes me more influential. They create me rather than solve the problems I raise.” The authorities keep him in the news by, for example, hounding him for tax evasion. This past summer, during a hearing on his tax case—which he was not allowed to attend—his studio was surrounded by about 30 police cars. The story was widely covered. In 2010, he established a studio in a proposed arts district in Shanghai. The regime, fearing it would become a center of dissent—and claiming the structure violated a building code—destroyed it early in 2011. According to Ai, “It made every young person who may or may not have liked me before think I must be some kind of hero.” Ai lives well enough, even under house arrest, but there’s little about him that’s extravagant or arty. His house, like many in the district, is gray and utilitarian. The neighborhood doesn’t have much street or café life; it’s the sort of place, one Beijing resident said, where people go to be left alone. His courtyard home consists of two buildings: a studio and a residence. The studio—a large space with a skylight—has a gray floor and white walls and seems much less cluttered than other artist studios. Both the studio and the residence have a neutral air, as if they have not yet been filled, but are instead environments where an artist waits for ideas, or acts on impulse, or greets cats and visitors. Like Andy Warhol, Ai always has a camera at hand—in his case, an iPhone—as if he were waiting for something to happen. His life seems steeped in “befores” and “afters.” Before the modern era, he says, China’s culture had a kind of “total condition, with philosophy, aesthetics, moral understanding and craftsmanship.” In ancient China, art could become very powerful. “It’s not just a decoration or one idea, but rather a total high model which art can carry out.” He finds a similar and transcendent unity of vision in the work of one of his favorite artists, van Gogh: “The art was a belief that expressed his views of the universe, how it should be.” His more immediate before, however, is not ancient China but the totalitarian culture into which he was born. Ai’s father, the renowned poet Ai Qing, ran afoul of the regime in the late ’50s and he and his family were sent to a labor camp. He spent five years cleaning toilets. (Ai Qing was exonerated in 1978 and lived in Beijing until his death in 1996.) To Ai Weiwei, there was also another, less personal kind of emptiness about the China of before. “There were almost no cars on the street,” he said. “No private cars, only embassy cars. You could walk in the middle of the street. It was very slow, very quiet and very gray. There were not so many expressions on human faces. After the Cultural Revolution, muscles were still not built up to laugh or show emotion. When you saw a little bit of color—like a yellow umbrella in the rain—it was quite shocking. The society was all gray, and a little bit blue.” In 1981, when it became possible for Chinese citizens to travel abroad, Ai made his way to New York. His first glimpse of the city came on a plane in the early evening. “It looked like a bowl of diamonds,” he said. It was not the city’s material wealth that attracted him, however, but its dazzling freedom of action and speech. For a time Ai had an apartment near Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, where young Chinese artists and intellectuals often gathered. But he had no particular success as an artist. He worked odd jobs and spent his time going to exhibitions. The poet Allen Ginsberg, whom he befriended, told Ai that galleries would not take much notice of his work. Although he has a special interest in Jasper Johns, Warhol and Dada, Ai is not easily categorized. He has a wandering mind that can embrace very different, sometimes contrary, elements. The same artist who loves the transcendental oneness of van Gogh, for example, also admires the abstruse and sometimes analytical sensibility of Johns. Much of Ai’s best-known work is rooted in conceptual and Dadaist art. He has often created “ready-mades”—objects taken from the world that an artist then alters or modifies—that have a strong satirical element. In one well-known example, he placed a Chinese figurine inside a bottle of Johnnie Walker Scotch. Yet in contrast to many conceptual artists, he also demonstrated, early on, a keen interest in a work’s visual qualities and sent himself to study at the Parsons School of Design and the Art Students League in New York. Ai’s interest in design and architecture led him, in 2006, to collaborate with HHF Architects on a country house in upstate New York for two young art collectors. The house is four equal-sized boxes covered on the outside in corrugated metal; the small spaces between the boxes permit light to suffuse the interior, where the geometry is also softened by wood and surprising angles. The award-winning design is both remarkably simple and—in its use of light and the grouping of interior spaces—richly complex. But Ai’s interest in design and architecture has less to do with being a conventional architect than with rebuilding—and redesigning—China itself. Returning to China in 1993, when his father fell ill, he was discouraged by two new forms of oppression: fashion and cronyism. “Deng Xiaoping encouraged people to get rich,” he said, adding that those who succeeded did so through their affiliation with the Communist Party. “I could see so many luxury cars, but there was no justice or fairness in this society. Far from it.” New consumer goods such as tape recorders brought fresh voices and music into a moribund culture. But rather than struggle to create independent identities, Ai said, young people instead settled into a new, easy and fashion-driven conformity. “People listened to sentimental Taiwanese pop music. Levi’s blue jeans came in very early. People were seeking to be identified with a certain kind of style, which saves a lot of talking.” Ai responded to the new China with scabrous satire, challenging its puritanical and conformist character by regularly showcasing a rude and boisterous individuality. He published a photograph of himself in which he is shown naked, leaping ludicrously into the air, while holding something over his genitals. The photo caption—“Grass mud horse covering the middle”—sounds in spoken Chinese like a coarse jest about mothers and the Central Committee. He formed a corporation called “Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd.” He mocked the Olympic Games, which, in China, are now a kind of state religion. The CCTV tower in Beijing, designed by the celebrated Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, is regarded with great national pride; the Chinese were horrified when a fire swept through an annex and a nearby hotel during construction. Ai’s response? “I think if the CCTV building really burns down it would be the modern landmark of Beijing. It can represent a huge empire of ambition burning down.” Ai’s resistance to all forms of control—capitalist and communist—manifests itself in one poignant way. He refuses to listen to music. He associates music with the propaganda of the old days and prefers the silent spaces of independent thought. “When I was growing up, we were forced to listen to only Communist music. I think that left a bad impression. I have many musician friends, but I never listen to music.” He blames the Chinese educational system for failing to generate any grand or open-ended sense of possibility either for individuals or the society as a whole. “Education should teach you to think, but they just want to control everyone’s mind.” What the regime is most afraid of, he says, is “free discussion.” Ai will occasionally say something optimistic. Perhaps the Internet will open up the discussion that schools now restrain, for example, even if the blog he ran has been shut down. For the most part, though, Ai’s commentary remains bleak and denunciatory. Few people in China believe in what they are doing, he says, not even the secret police. “I’ve been interrogated by over eight people, and they all told me, ‘This is our job.’...They do not believe anything. But they tell me, ‘You can never win this war.’” Not soon anyway. In the West, the artist as provocateur—Marcel Duchamp, Warhol and Damien Hirst are well-known examples—is a familiar figure. In a China just emerging as a world power, where the political authorities prize conformity, discipline and the accumulation of riches, an artist working in the provocative Western tradition is still regarded as a threat. Chinese intellectuals may support him, but the Chinese generally have no more understanding of Ai than a typical American has of Duchamp or Warhol. “There are no heroes in modern China,” Ai said. The West would like to turn Ai into a hero, but he seems reluctant to oblige. He lived in postmodern New York. He knows the celebrity racket and the hero racket. “I don’t believe that much in my own answer,” he said. “My resistance is a symbolic gesture.” But Ai, if not a hero, has found ways to symbolize certain qualities that China may one day celebrate him for protecting and asserting. Free discussion is one. An out-there, dark and Rabelaisian playfulness is another. But the most interesting quality of them all is found in his best works of art: a prophetic dream of China. Much of Ai’s art is of only passing interest. Like so much conceptual art, it seems little more than a diagram of some pre-conceived moral. Art with a moral too often ends with the moral, which can stopper the imagination. Consider Ai’s amusing and well-known Johnnie Walker piece. Is it suggesting that China is enveloped within—and intoxicated by—Western consumer culture? Of course it is. Once you’ve seen it, you don’t have to think about it anymore. Jokes, even serious jokes, are like that. They’re not as good the second time around. But several Ai works are fundamentally different in character. They’re made of more than morals and commentary. They’re open-ended, mysterious, sometimes utopian in spirit. Each calls to mind—as architecture and design can—the birth of the new. The oddest instance is the “Bird’s Nest” stadium of the 2008 Olympics. While an impassioned critic of the propaganda around the Olympics, Ai nonetheless collaborated with the architects Herzog & de Meuron in the design of the stadium. What kind of China is being nurtured, one wonders, in that spiky nest? According to Ai, governments cannot hide forever from what he calls “principles” and “the true argument.” He decries the loss of religion, aesthetic feeling and moral judgment, arguing that “this is a large space that needs to be occupied.” To occupy that space, Ai continues to dream of social transformation, and he devises actions and works that evoke worlds of possibility. For the 2007 Documenta—a famous exhibition of contemporary art held every five years in Kassel, Germany—Ai contributed two pieces. One was a monumental sculpture called Template, a chaotic Babel of doors and windows from ruined Ming and Qing dynasty houses. These doors and windows from the past seemed to lead nowhere until, oddly enough, a storm knocked down the sculpture. His second contribution was a work of “social sculpture” called Fairytale, for which he brought 1,001 people from China—chosen through an open blog invitation—to Documenta. He designed their clothes, luggage and a place for them to stay. But he did not point them in any particular direction. On this unlikely trip through the woods, the Chinese pilgrims might find for themselves a new and magical world. They too might discover, as Ai did when he went to New York, “a bowl of diamonds.” Sunflower Seeds, his most celebrated work, yields similar questions. The painting of so many individual seeds is a slightly mad tour de force. But the scale of the work, which is at once tiny and vast—raindrop and ocean—seems no crazier than a “Made in China” consumer society and its bottomless desires. Does the number of seeds reflect the dizzying amount of money—millions, billions, trillions—that corporations and nations generate? Do the seeds simultaneously suggest the famines that mark Chinese history? Do they evoke China’s brief moment of cultural freedom in 1956 known as the “Hundred Flowers Campaign?” Do they represent both the citizen and the nation, the individual and the mass, endowing both with an air of germinating possibility? Will China ever bloom, one wonders, with the joyful intensity of van Gogh’s sunflowers?

{"id": 34, "data": "Ai Weiwei  A global citizen, artist and thinker, Ai Weiwei moves between modes of production and investigation, subject to the direction and outcome of his research, whether into the Chinese earthquake of 2008 (for works such as Straight, 2008-12 and Remembering, 2009) or the worldwide plight of refugees and forced migrants (for Law of the Journey and his feature-length documentary, Human Flow, both 2017). From early iconoclastic positions in regards to authority and history, which included Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn and a series of middle-finger salutes to sites of power, Study of Perspective (both 1995), Ai’s production expanded to encompass architecture, public art and performance. Beyond concerns of form or protest, Ai now measures our existence in relation to economic, political, natural and social forces, uniting craftsmanship with conceptual creativity. Universal symbols of humanity and community, such as bicycles, flowers and trees, as well as the perennial problems of borders and conflicts are given renewed potency though installations, sculptures, films and photographs, while Ai continues to speak out publicly on issues he believes important. He is one of the leading cultural figures of his generation and serves as an example for free expression both in China and internationally. Ai Weiwei was born in 1957 in Beijing and now lives and works in Berlin. He attended Beijing Film Academy and later, on moving to New York (1983–1993), continued his studies at the Parsons School of Design. Major solo exhibitions include Albertina Modern, Vienna, Austria (2022); Hawai'i Contemporary, Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA (2022); Kettle's Yard, Cambridge, UK (2022); Serralves Museum, Porto, Portugal (2021); Cordoaria Nacional, Lisbon, Portugal (2021); Imperial War Museum, London, UK (2020); K20/K21, Düsseldorf, Germany (2019); OCA, São Paulo, Brazil (2018); Corpartes, Santiago, Chile (2018); Mucem, Marseille, France (2018); PROA, Buenos Aires, Argentina (2017); Sakip Sabanci, Museum, Istanbul, Turkey (2017); Public Art Fund, New York, NY, USA (2017); Israel Museum, Jerusalem (2017); Palazzo Strozzi, Florence, Italy  (2016); 21er Haus, Vienna, Austria (2016); Helsinki Art Museum, Finland (2016); Royal Academy, London, UK (2015); Martin Gropius Bau, Berlin, Germany (2014); Indianapolis Museum of Art, IN, USA (2013); Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C., USA (2012); Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taiwan (2011); Tate Modern, London, UK (2010) and Haus der Kunst, Munich, Germany (2009). Architectural collaborations include the 2012 Serpentine Pavilion and the 2008 Beijing Olympic Stadium, with Herzog and de Meuron. Among numerous awards and honours, he won the lifetime achievement award from the Chinese Contemporary Art Awards in 2008 and was made Honorary Academician at the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 2011. His human rights work has been recognised through the Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent in 2012 and Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience Award in 2015.

An outspoken human rights activist, Ai was arrested by Chinese authorities in April 2011 and held incommunicado for three months. Upon his release, he was prohibited from traveling abroad, engaging in public speech, and was subjected to continued government surveillance. Ai’s position as a provocateur and dissident artist informs the tenor and reception of much of his recent work. He infuses his sculptures, photographs, and public artworks with political conviction and personal poetry, often making use of recognizable and historic Chinese art forms in critical examinations of a host of contemporary Chinese political and social issues. In his sculptural works he often uses reclaimed materials—ancient pottery and wood from destroyed temples—in a conceptual gesture that connects tradition with contemporary social concerns. He also employs sarcasm, juxtaposition, and repetition to reinvigorate the potency and symbolism of traditional images and to reframe the familiar with minimal means. A writer and curator, Ai extends his practice across multiple disciplines and through social media to communicate with a global public and to engage fellow artists with projects on a massive scale. Ai Weiwei attended the Beijing Film Academy and the Parsons School of Design in New York. He has received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Politics and Social Science, University of Ghent, Belgium (2010), as well as many awards, including the Skowhegan Medal (2011) and the Chinese Contemporary Art Award (2008). His work has appeared in major exhibitions at Kunsthaus Bregenz (2011); the Victoria & Albert Museum, London (2011); Asia Society Museum, New York (2011); Tate Modern, London (2010); São Paulo Bienal (2010); Haus der Kunst, Munich (2009); Mori Art Museum, Tokyo (2009); and Documenta XII (2007).

In Search of Humanity deals in depth with the aspects of humanity and artistic commentary in the work of Ai Weiwei. His earliest works were already characterized by an examination of his native China, where he experienced the effects of the Cultural Revolution as a child through the exile of his father, the great poet Ai Qing. As a young man in New York’s East Village in the 1980s, he witnessed and documented the protest movements there.\n 8 Images.\nExhibtion view | Photos © Sandro E. E.

His outstretched middle finger, which he held up to well-known buildings as representative objects of power, thus denouncing injustices, ultimately became his trademark. Time and again, the artist addresses power structures and the mechanisms of exercising power, be it the destruction of cultural heritage as an expression of one’s own superiority or the exercise of manipulation, censorship, and surveillance by the state. He unrelentingly takes a closer look wherever he sees freedom of expression and human rights in danger—from the Chinese government’s methods of intimidation and the threats to journalists and political activists to the protests in Hong Kong, the massive restrictions in Wuhan during the outbreak of the corona pandemic, and even his own detainment in 2011.\n Ai regards the current situation of refugees around the world as perhaps the greatest global humanitarian crisis since the Second World War, and as an enormous challenge for us as a solidary society—and he sees each and every one of us as having a responsibility to take action. The exhibition is on view from 16 March until 4 September 2022.\n Exhibtion view | Photos © Sandro E. E. Zanzinger.\nExhibtion view | Photos © Sandro E. E.

{"id": 41, "data": "Advertisement Ai Weiwei photographed by Gao Yuan, 2014. © Ai Weiwei Studio; courtesy Lisson Gallery The artist and human rights activist discusses the power of writing, the poetry of his father, and the artworld’s self-serving ideologies Contemporary artist and human-rights activist Ai Weiwei came to international prominence for his open criticism of the Chinese government’s autocratic rule and its human rights policies, a position that resulted in the state’s efforts to silence his condemnations via sustained intimidation, a 2009 attack by the police that left him with a brain haemorrhage and a three-month imprisonment in 2011. Following the unannounced demolition of his Beijing studio in 2018 by local authorities, Ai relocated to Berlin. His memoir 1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows (2021) tells the story of China’s political and social history over the last century through the intertwined experiences of Ai and his father, the renowned modernist poet Ai Qing, who was exiled for two decades, including a period of hard labour in Xinjiang. ArtReview How did you approach writing 1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows? Ai Weiwei I always need to be balanced: to not get too emotionally involved and to be a little bit cool in tone. Otherwise the emotions are often overwhelming. On the one hand because the book spans 100 years of China’s history (and that’s a large period to cover) – but on the other because it reflects the history of two people: me and my father. I wanted it to be balanced so that it wasn’t too much about us, but rather sets our stories within a historical context. AR How do you see the relationship between writing and making art? AWW Ideally they should be one. As someone who has always been interested in conceptual art, I have always thought the form and concept should be undivided. It would be too arrogant or misleading to just give a form without a clear conceptual interpretation of the work. If it’s just about the words, it can be too obvious and dry: it doesn’t have charm. It needs to be balanced. Artworks can have specific meanings but can be vague and abstract at the same time. For me, writing is like a clear measurement of how far you can go with an idea: it’s black words on white paper; there’s a clear definition. AR You’ve previously said that you hate ‘hidden meanings’. But your artwork does have a lot of hidden meanings… AWW That’s the nature of art. It has to be able to be interpreted by itself and often it has multiple meanings. But that’s why I need to write. For me, writing is part of the art practice because it sets a clear meaning. However, it doesn’t have the same emotion as the artwork. That’s why I have to have both.

Courtesy Lisson Gallery.\nAR Your father, Ai Qing, was a renowned modernist poet, and in your book you mention these handwritten messages that were placed in public known as Big-character Posters, some examples of which were used by the state to denounce your father, but also one written anonymously by someone called Mechanic No. 0538, who used this format to criticise Mao Zedong – did language play a role in your becoming an artist and the process behind your practice? AWW I think language has had a very profound impact on my work. When my father wrote poetry he was very careful in selecting his vocabulary, as are all poets. So that method of using a limited number of words to carry a powerful idea has always been very attractive to me – to see how language functions. I think, with any form of art practice, control is a crucial skill. So choosing words, form, materials carefully is the best means of expression. And expression itself is a selection of emotions and concepts. That process reflects the uniqueness of any individual work. It’s not about fitting all your ideas into one thing, but about reducing it and in fact excluding certain emotions and concepts. AR Is that opposite to the way you grew up absorbing words and phrases used in Communist propaganda that were taught to you at school? Because there was an expectation that you would accept these ideas given by the state without question? AWW Yes. I think it’s about trying to limit yourself from becoming another kind of propagandist. It’s about saying something carefully but also acting on it. And to act on the ideas is crucial, otherwise they just become antiwords. They function with no meaning. Ai Weiwei, Trace , 2014, Lego. © Ai Weiwei Studio. Courtesy Lisson Gallery.\nAR How do you act on your ideas? AWW I try to use different media: writing for social media, making videos, films and images, installations or even using pieces of Lego. Firstly, there is a challenge in understanding a particular medium; it takes a great effort to learn to control materials – whether it’s porcelain-making or Chinese carpentry – as well as knowledge of how these materials have been used throughout history. Secondly, you have to find the right material for the right concept. For example I used Lego for Trace (2014), a series of portraits of political prisoners, because it was necessary to give all the images the same kind of quality; at the same time, it was important to show they are distinct from one another – and Lego felt like the perfect medium for this. Similarly, with Sunflower Seeds (2010), porcelain has a huge tradition in Jingdezhen [where the work was fabricated by 1,600 artisans over a period of two-and-a-half years]: every woman knows how to make porcelain, which involves a very sophisticated process, but they make them just like they make dumplings. That’s the beauty of it. You have one hundred million porcelain sunflower seeds, but at the same time, it’s just like how every Chinese household would put dumplings in their wok and boil it. I still think of it as a miracle. But in every artwork, each different medium takes the same kind of effort to make sure that the aesthetic and moral work together to communicate an idea. To act on an idea is to make art, because the fight for freedom is part of freedom. Ai Weiwei, Sunflower Seeds , 2010, 100 million hand painted ceramic seeds. © Ai Weiwei Studio. Courtesy Lisson Gallery.\nAR And what’s been your most important act so far? AWW The most important thing I have done is to set up different ways of communicating social and political issues, and not just doing something that is self-indulgent, but rather to test if that expression really functions as a way of reflecting humanity and human dignity. If you took away my writing – the blogs, the social media messages, the book – my so-called artwork would fall apart. It’s like flesh and bones. To be alive, we have to have these connected structures of bones and tissue. That’s how my art comes alive. AR Do you think your written ideas have a greater impact than your artworks? AWW That is very hard to measure, partly because this book has just come out. I used to think people liked watching films, and I made so many films. But it depends on the circumstance, because in China, people love to watch films, but in the West, no one goes to theatres anymore – they just react quickly to social-media images. So the book really hasn’t been tested yet in the West. I used to write blogs in China, which were extremely popular. I believe that is the reason for the police brutality and attention from the state. If I had just made the artworks, I wouldn’t have had a problem. Even in detention, the interrogators never asked me about my artworks, except for when I flipped the finger at Tiananmen [Study in Perspective – Tiananmen, 1995]. I told them I did it to the White House too, but the interrogator said, ‘I’m a Chinese policeman, I’m taking care of my duties, and if you did that to the White House, the US police should take care of that’. So, basically, in prison they read my blogs to me as evidence of subverting state power; the texts were critical of the Chinese government and of the party. They even asked me to reread them, and asked me if I agreed with their judgment. I said, ‘I do.’ Ai Weiwei, from the series Study of Perspective , 1995-2011 / 2014, 40 black-and-white and colour C-prints / diasec. © Ai Weiwei Studio. Courtesy Lisson Gallery.\nAR Do you feel there’s a connection between your and your father’s writing? AWW Well, his writing was very calm with good intentions, and my writing is quite brutal and harsh. He faced 20 years of exile; the police told me that I’d have been killed if I had been writing during that time. But it’s very clear that our experiences correlate in some ways, I think. My father went to Paris before he was twenty years old, to become an artist and poet; I went to New York to study. We have both been subject to the enforcement of state laws as individuals who have spoken our minds. I feel proud to be identified as an individual who can still defend freedom of expression. AR Since moving to the West, do you see any ways in which the power structures here reflect some of those in China? AWW I think China is clearly a very authoritarian society, and that has been the history of the country for 2,000–3,000 years. It never really changed. But for the past 200 years, the West has undergone an Industrial Revolution, and before that there was the Renaissance. Democratic systems were established in the West, but capitalism is a competing structure that creates different problems. In the West, on the surface, there’s liberty and individual freedom and an encouragement of people’s so-called creativity, but the world is so much controlled by corporate culture that those ideas are economically challenged because the corporate powers hide within the political, educational and media structures. So here we’re facing a very different structural problem. AR And how does that impact the artworld? AWW I think the artworld is basically dominated by certain ideologies that are self-serving, and capital-oriented. Artworks have to be recognised by important dealers and galleries, and have to be bought by collectors, which might then be donated to museums. It means sacrificing a huge amount of education and effort and creativity to fit into that system, in which it seems impossible to achieve success. In the West, education is fixated on telling people how to become successful – those ideas are taught in school education and through mainstream value judgements. That is the problem. It’s a pollutant, and opposite to the idea of the individual.

Ai Weiwei An in-depth interview with the artist on his cultural experiences and greatest influences, from Marcel Duchamp to ancient Chinese ceramics—and why Romanticism is not for him Sponsored by Hosted by Ben Luke . Produced by Julia Michalska , David Clack , Aimee Dawson and Henrietta Bentall.\n23 February 2022 Share Ai Weiwei Courtesy of Ai Weiwei Studio A brush with... In this podcast, based on The Art Newspaper's regular interview series, our host Ben Luke talks to artists in-depth. He asks the questions you've always wanted to: who are the artists, historical and contemporary, they most admire? Which are the museums they return to? What are the books, music and other media that most inspire them? And what is art for, anyway?.\nBen Luke talks to Ai Weiwei about his influences, from art to literature, film and music, and the cultural experiences that have shaped his life and work. Ai, born in Beijing in 1957, is an artist who needs little introduction; he is among the most famous artists in the world, principally due to the activism which led him to be incarcerated in his native China for months without charge in 2011. Part of Ai Weiwei's Study of Perspective, a series of middle-finger salutes directed at significant institutions, landmarks and monuments from around the world Since his release he has not let up and he continues to be a thorn in the Chinese government’s side, relentlessly documenting and publicly speaking out against its attacks on freedom and manifold other human rights abuses. Ai Weiwei's Surveillance Camera with Plinth (2014) Courtesy Ai Weiwei Studio And while this conversation addresses his political activities it also explores his wider work, including the early objects inspired by Marcel Duchamp, his first pieces made with ancient Chinese ceramics, his middle-finger salutes, Study of Perspective, and the huge actions, like Fairytale at Documenta in 2007, for which he has come to be best known. He also answers the questions we ask all our guests, including the ultimate: what is art for? • Ai Weiwei: The Liberty of Doubt, Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, UK, until 19 June; Intertwine, Serralves Museum, Porto, Portugal, until 9 July.

Through expressionist brushwork, surrealist methodology, and self-conscious amateurism he engages with the history of abstract painting, pushing the basic components of abstraction to new extremes. Oehlen studied at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg in Germany from 1978 to 1981 and quickly rose to prominence in the Berlin and Cologne art scenes. He came to be associated with the Junge Wilde artists, including Martin Kippenberger and Werner Büttner, who sought to create work that defied categorization and refuted the artistic status quo. Straddling various debates surrounding the nature of painting, Oehlen’s work deconstructed the medium to its constituent elements—color, gesture, motion, and time—and evolved out of constraints he applied to his artistic process. This line of investigation, which Oehlen has continued to pursue in the decades since has resulted in striking variations between—from works that combine abstract and figurative styles, created in response to the Neo-Expressionism of the 1980s, to paintings comprising of grids of colored squares. As Oehlen began to incorporate new technologies into his work—inkjet printers, computer-aided design programs, and references to the pixelated lines of computer screens—the parameters that he set for himself shifted, offering new obstacles and challenges. Some of these self-imposed “rules” include limiting his palette and combining perambulating black lines with carefully blended gradations (in the Baumbilder [Tree Paintings]), and utilizing erasure and layering to juxtapose bright and muddy colors, as in the Elevator Paintings, a single work in nine parts from 2016. In the late 1990s, Oehlen spray-painted over collaged imagery that had been transferred to canvas with large, industrial printers typically used to create billboards. Oehlen is perhaps best known for his embrace of “bad” painting. Alongside his many rules, he allows a certain awkwardness or ugliness to enter his work, introducing unsettling gestures, crudely drawn figures, visceral smears of artificial pigments, bold hues, and flesh tones. In this way, he attests to the infinite combinations of form made possible through painting, and shows that these combinations can be manipulated at the artist’s will to produce novel perceptual challenges for the viewer.\n Photo: Katherine McMahon #AlbertOehlen Facebook Twitter E-mail.\nDownload Selected exhibition history (PDF).\nExhibitions Extended through September 11, 2021 Albert Oehlen\n            \nTramonto Spaventoso June 10–September 11, 2021 Marciano Art Foundation, Los Angeles.\nAlbert Oehlen\n            \nTramonto Spaventoso April 22–June 5, 2021 Beverly Hills.\nExtended through November 9, 2019 Albert Oehlen\n            \nNew Paintings September 12–November 9, 2019 Hong Kong.\nAlbert Oehlen\n            \nSEXE, RELIGION, POLITIQUE October 13–December 21, 2018 rue de Ponthieu, Paris.\nAlbert Oehlen\n            \nElevator Paintings: Trees February 28–April 15, 2017 West 21st Street, New York.\nAlbert Oehlen February 5–March 24, 2016 Grosvenor Hill, London.\nAlbert Oehlen\n            \n“Home & Garden” Annex June 17–September 4, 2015 Park & 75, New York.\nAlbert Oehlen\n            \nNew Paintings June 6–July 18, 2014 Beverly Hills.\nSee all Exhibitions for Albert Oehlen.\nFrom the Quarterly Albert Oehlen: Terrifying Sunset The artist speaks with Mark Godfrey about his new paintings, touching on the works’ relationship to John Graham, the Rothko Chapel, and Leigh Bowery.\n Now available\nGagosian Quarterly Summer 2021 The Summer 2021 issue of Gagosian Quarterly is now available, featuring Carrie Mae Weems’s The Louvre (2006) on its cover.\n In Conversation\nAlbert Oehlen and Mark Godfrey Albert Oehlen speaks to Mark Godfrey about a recent group of abstract paintings, “academic” art, reversing habits, and questioning rules.\n Albert Oehlen: In the Studio This film by Albert Oehlen, with music by Tim Berresheim, takes us inside the artist’s studio in Switzerland as he works on a new painting.\n In Conversation\nAlbert Oehlen and Hans Ulrich Obrist Hans Ulrich Obrist interviews the artist on the occasion of his recent exhibition at the Serpentine Galleries, London.\n Albert Oehlen: Maximum Chance Maximum Control The artist met with art historian Christian Malycha to discuss his newest paintings.\n Now available\nGagosian Quarterly Fall 2019 The Fall 2019 issue of Gagosian Quarterly is now available, featuring a detail from Sinking (2019) by Nathaniel Mary Quinn on its cover.\n Cows by the Water At the Palazzo Grassi, Venice, a career-spanning exhibition of paintings by Albert Oehlen, entitled Cows by the Water, went on view in the spring of 2018.

Oehlen (b. 1954, Krefeld, Germany) has been a key figure in contemporary art since the 1980s. By bringing together abstract, figurative, collaged and computer-generated elements on the canvas, he continues to explore an inventive diversity of artistic approaches. Through Expressionist brushwork, Surrealist gestures and deliberate amateurism, Oehlen engages with the history of painting, pushing its essential components of colour, gesture, motion and time to bold new extremes.  From 1978 to 1981, Oehlen studied at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg under painter Sigmar Polke. Subsequently, he quickly rose to prominence, moving between different artist groups and scenes in Berlin and Cologne. It was during this time in the 1980s that these artists sought to create works that defied categorisation and contradicted the existing artistic status quo. Oehlen’s practice has since traversed diverse movements and styles, combining narrative and abstraction, blending the handmade with the electronic and machinic in his computer or ‘bionic’ paintings and experimenting with form, tone and texture within set, premeditated parameters in his ‘grey’ and ‘tree’ paintings. This exhibition at the Serpentine focuses on a recurring thread in Oehlen’s practice through a selection of works dating from the 1980s until the present day, which are brought together under the rubric of the John Graham Remix series. Taking its title from the eponymous American Modernist figurative painter, this body of work appropriates elements of Graham’s painting, Tramonto Spaventoso (‘Terrifying Sunset’) (1940–49), which have then been interpreted, remixed and reconfigured by Oehlen across multiple compositions. Graham’s painting becomes a singular starting point for the artist’s experimentation, ‘a vehicle for endless interpretation’ that he has continued to return to throughout his career. The unique architecture of the Serpentine Gallery, in particular its domed central space, was the site of a new installation that forms part of Oehlen’s interpretation of the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas, founded by John and Dominique de Menil. A selection of new paintings based on Graham’s painting, which match the scale and size of the four horizontal paintings by American painter Mark Rothko displayed in the original chapel’s interior spaces, were exhibited at the Serpentine for the first time. Permeating this gallery is a newly configured soundtrack by the hardcore, avant-garde trio ensemble, Steamboat Switzerland, playing at intervals throughout the day, which draws connections between the movements, rhythms and systems of music and the internal strategies of Oehlen’s paintings. Oehlen’s site-specific response to the Serpentine Gallery follows his interest in extending the internal logics of his paintings to the sites in which they are exhibited. It is this significance of architecture that results in unique installations that have a distinctly mutable relationship to space. As the artist says: “I am not interested in the idea of staging my work in a space specifically conceived for it. I think that art should adapt to the architecture or fight with it.”.\nSerpentine Gallery 2 October 2019 — 2 February 2020 Free.\nShare Share on Facebook Share on Twitter.\nsupporters.\nAlbert Oehlen\nSelbstportrait mit Pferd, 1985\n© Albert Oehlen\nPhoto: Archive Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin | Paris Albert Oehlen\nOhne Titel (Schellen), 1988\n© Albert Oehlen\nPhoto: Archive Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin | Paris Albert Oehlen\nOhne Titel, 1989\n© Albert Oehlen\nPhoto: Archive Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin | Paris Albert Oehlen\nOhne Titel, 1993\n© Albert Oehlen\nPhoto: Archive Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin | Paris Albert Oehlen\nCheck Up, 1994\n© Albert Oehlen\nPhoto: Archive Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin | Paris Sohn von Hundescheisse 1999\nOil on canvas\n278 × 359 cm\nPrivate Collection\nPhoto: Archive Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin | Paris\n© Albert Oehlen Albert Oehlen\nArrogantes Genie am Steuer, 1999\n© Albert Oehlen\nPhoto: Jörg + Philipp von Bruchhausen Alber Oehlen (Installation view of Vorfahrt für immer, 1998, Mixed media on canvas, 196 x 196 cm, Private Collection, Düsseldorf) © 2019 Photo: readsreads.info Albert Oehlen (Installation view, 2 October 2019 – 2 February 2020, Serpentine Galleries) © 2019 Photo: readsreads.info Albert Oehlen (Installation view, 2 October 2019 – 2 February 2020, Serpentine Galleries) © 2019 Photo: readsreads.info Albert Oehlen (Installation view, 2 October 2019 – 2 February 2020, Serpentine Galleries) © 2019 Photo: readsreads.info Albert Oehlen (Installation view of Grünaug – Dunkelaug 1997 Oil on canvas 200 x 240 cm Courtesy the artist) © 2019 Photo: readsreads.info Alber Oehlen (Installation view of Abgaskopf 1998 / 1984 Oil on canvas 192 x 192.6 cm The Albertina Museum, Vienna.

{"id": 49, "data": "ARTIST: Albert Oehlen.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\nDescending Hot Rays, 2003\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t280 x 300 cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nDescending Hot Rays, 2003\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t280 x 300 cm Albert Oehlen’s paintings are neither beautiful nor seductive. Their self-consciously brutal surfaces seem to be corrupted from within, a perversion of the paintings they might have been. In Descending Hot Rays, Albert Oehlen’s monotone canvas occupies a space between representation and abstraction, his forms and textures converging not to create an illusion, but a suggestion of invention. Traditional painterly expression is infused with a steely reference to technology. His work offers a raw confrontation with the deficiencies of visual language. Albert Oehlen doesn’t use paint to convey meaning, but rather to explore the possibilities of the medium’s ‘function’.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nBlack Rationality, 1982\n\t\t\n\t\tLatex on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t260x 190 cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nBlack Rationality, 1982\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLatex on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t260x 190 cm Black Rationality appropriates the tones and equestrian subject of historical painting and re-renders them as a punk-ethic effigy. The skeletons of the horses provide a Picasso-like motif. Seemingly two paintings in one, Black Rationality is a painting in conflict. Albert Oehlen sets up the flatness of an abstract expressionist ground; the figures are placed as a separate layer creating an illusion of perspective. In an optical contention between surface and depth, Albert Oehlen exposes the limitations of both abstraction and representation to denounce and eulogise artistic tradition. In a literal depiction of a graveyard, Albert Oehlen presents painting as a hallowed myth, resonant beyond its expiration.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nFibreglass Scroll, 2004\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t270 x 220 cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nFibreglass Scroll, 2004\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t270 x 220 cm Albert Oehlen’s paintings humorously critique the hallowed respect and predominant values of traditional painting. In Fibreglass Scroll, his sensitively treated surface adopts the ephemeral radiance of Abstract Expressionism, alluding to an aura of mysticism and spirituality. Devoid of colour, Albert Oehlen’s passionate brushwork becomes a hollow gesture; his black and white palette relegates the sincerity of painting to the annals of history. Stylised flat shapes float above Albert Oehlen’s painterly field, transforming his abstract composition to a Picasso-like animal, uncontrollably wild and dumb.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nMirage of Steel, 2003\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t280 x 340 cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nMirage of Steel, 2003\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t280 x 340 cm Albert Oehlen relishes the sensitivity of his medium in this celebration of painterly illusion: puddles and washes convey a refracted, dreamlike sensibility, while almost recognisable objects emerge and dissolve against the fluid ground. An explicit confession of deception, Albert Oehlen creates a convincing sense of space: a purely abstract fabrication boldly exposing its own construction.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nPeon, 1996\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t191.5 x 191.5cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nPeon, 1996\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t191.5 x 191.5cm Oehlen approaches painting with the uncontrollability of Tourette's syndrome. Chaotic and visually overloaded, Peon exudes an earnest conviction undermined by its own frantic expression. Elements of composition and style undulate with individual promise. Together, they are mutually rejective compounds violently clamouring for attention. Oehlen presents an image of breakdown: painting in its most agitated state, clawing for meaning and reason.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nTitankatze Mit Versuchstier (Titanium Cat With Laboratory Tested Animal), 1999\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t209 x 300 cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nTitankatze Mit Versuchstier (Titanium Cat With Laboratory Tested Animal), 1999\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t209 x 300 cm Titanium Cat… reads like a page torn from a 1950’s exhibition catalogue: an exaggeratedly expressionistic painting entirely stripped of colour. Rendered defunct from the start, Albert Oehlen revels in its self-styled retardation. A decoded script of interrupted image and muted texture, takes its pleasure in contrast and surface.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nUntitled, 1993\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t200 x 200cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nUntitled, 1993\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t200 x 200cm Oehlen describes his paintings as \"post-non-representational\". Through exploring and challenging the tropes and expectations of conventional abstraction, he strives to reconstitute a contemporary meaning for art as an independently articulate form. In works such as Untitled, Oehlen lavishes the picture plane with a clich’d exaggeration of painterly expression. Awkwardly encumbered, the sophistication of Untitled lies in its audacity, teetering on the razor edge between misfortune and masterpiece.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nUntitled, 1989\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on Canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t213.5 x 162.5cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nUntitled, 1989\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on Canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t213.5 x 162.5cm Albert Oehlen is a master of ironic wit and his paintings are elaborate strategies of provocation. In Untitled, Albert Oehlen subverts the authority of the avant-garde, creating an abstraction of dumbed-down abjection. His painting poses as a deceptive icon of aesthetic contemplation, punctuated with flirtatious eyes returning the viewer’s gaze.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nThe Greeting, 2003\n\t\t\n\t\tOil and Inkjet Print on Wood\n\t\t\n\t\t208 x 280cm <br><br> (Collaboration with Jonathan Meese) Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nThe Greeting, 2003\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil and Inkjet Print on Wood\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t208 x 280cm <br><br> (Collaboration with Jonathan Meese) In a collaborative process made simple, Albert Oehlen provides the photographic material and both artists take turns painting around it. None of these works are immediately recognisable as Albert Oehlen or Meese, and that’s what makes them so good. Like a nuclear fusion, the two become one; an invincible super-artist refining the best qualities of both. The Greeting is a ridiculous portrait of a lumpy gangly-armed housewife waving about a feather duster/penis, teetering on glamour model’s legs. They render her almost obscenely repulsive, but the sexual delusion of the male gaze is inevitable: the artists’ collage in a mirror to peek up her dress.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nSituation, 2003\n\t\t\n\t\tOil and inkjet on wood\n\t\t\n\t\t208 x 280cm <br><br> (Collaboration with Jonathan Meese) Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nSituation, 2003\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil and inkjet on wood\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t208 x 280cm <br><br> (Collaboration with Jonathan Meese) Albert Oehlen and Jonathan Meese both make paintings about failure: of the function of art, politics and ideological systems. Working collaboratively, they explore these terrains in a hard-hitting and overtly humorous way. Situation creates a highly sexed still life: a mangled-faced female figure reduced to tits and a brain. Dealing with issues of visual ideals and sexual politics, their cyborg superwoman is less an archetype of perfection than the suggestive abstract sculptures on the plinth beside her.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nDJ Techno, 2001\n\t\t\n\t\tMixed media on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t360 x 340cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nDJ Techno, 2001\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMixed media on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t360 x 340cm Oehlen re-contextualises painting as an expanded field. His most recent works are often produced through computer-generated design, incorporating collaged elements of photography and ink-jet printing as a means to explore new territories of representation and reception. DJ Techno combines pop emblems with Kandinsky-like expressionism to create an image with synaesthetic effect, alluding to sensations other than the visual.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nPiece, 2003\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on Canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t280 x 340cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nPiece, 2003\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on Canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t280 x 340cm In Piece, Albert Oehlen combines aspects of figurative sexuality, mechanical distance and painterly abstraction. It’s a bastard hybrid of painting, incorporating smooth polished forms, heavy brushwork, and the implied photo-gloss of airbrush. The end result is more like a collage than a painting: a loud and exasperating argument in different tongues, promising never to be resolved for lack of a common idiom.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nUntitled, 1989\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t200 x 200cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nUntitled, 1989\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t200 x 200cm Albert Oehlen describes his paintings as ‘post-non-representational’. Through exploring and challenging the tropes and expectations of conventional abstraction, he strives to reconstitute a contemporary meaning for art as an independently articulate form. In works such as Untitled, Albert Oehlen lavishes the picture plane with a clichéd exaggeration of painterly expression. Awkwardly encumbered, the sophistication of Untitled lies in its audacity, teetering on the razor edge between misfortune and masterpiece.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nStorm, 2004\n\t\t\n\t\tOil and Inkjet Print on Wood\n\t\t\n\t\t208 x 280cm <br><br> (Collaboration with Jonathan Meese) Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nStorm, 2004\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil and Inkjet Print on Wood\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t208 x 280cm <br><br> (Collaboration with Jonathan Meese) Describing their merger as a courtly affair of awkward politeness punctuated by artistic embarrassment, Albert Oehlen & Jonathan Meese unite forces as a way to expand both practice and dialogue. Like a conceptual game of tennis, an artwork is begun, and then bantered back and forth until it gains a life of its own. For the artists, it’s a way to accept loosing control over a work, explore the possibility of spontaneous action and reaction, and stamp out self-indulgent excess like a bad habit. The end results are both breathtaking and funny. Storm  cheekily sets computer-generated porn as the hot-bod for a wild-armed monstress: a goddess of violent temper and salvation.\n Albert Oehlen\n\t\t\nInterior, 1998\n\t\t\n\t\tOil on Canvas\n\t\t\n\t\t238 x 238 cm Close.\nAlbert Oehlen\n\t\t\t\t\nInterior, 1998\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOil on Canvas\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t238 x 238 cm Albert Oehlen denies Interior both colour and pictorial subject. Instead, he offers the canvas as a rudimentary plan, a crude impression of possibility. By denying customary modes of critique, Albert Oehlen questions how the function and value of painting might be developed outside a historical hierarchy of aesthetics and form.\n × VISITING SAATCHI GALLERY Open Monday – Sunday, 10am – 6pm\nLast entry: 5.30pm\nThe Gallery will be CLOSED from 30 April to 9 June 2022 inclusive.

{"id": 50, "data": "About\nthe artist Albert Oehlen (b.1954, Krefield, Germany) lives and works in Switzerland. He studied at the Hochschule für Bildende Kunst, Hamburg and was professor in the painting department at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf between 2000 and 2009. Oehlen stands apart from the established perception of painting as a form of self-expression. While the inherent value or purpose of art remains ambiguous, the sentimental power it can hold for both creator and viewer is rarely denied. Surpassing the bounds of formal modernism, he indulges in the use of bold colours, forms and spatial relationships, searching to explore the functions of the medium, rather than its capacity to convey meaning and incite emotion. Through his work Oehlen is promulgating a harsh and confronting answer to the deficiencies of visual representation, incessantly seeking to reinvent and reshape methods of painting in opposition to the aforementioned traditional hierarchies. During his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Hamburg, he identified a desire to be involved with a medium that quintessentially represented High Art but which was coming under attack for its staid and unimaginative values. During the 1980s, a shared antipathy towards this status quo resulted in the formation of a group of artists in Germany, Switzerland and Austria who came to be known as the Neue Wilde or Junge Wilde (“Wild New” or “Wild Youth”). Characterised by neon-bright blocks of colour, with highly controlled and wildly spontaneous brushstrokes side by side, the Neue Wilde painted through a dispute of ideas. This conflict, representative of the angst artists of the movement felt towards their historical predecessors, was to be expressed stylistically rather than figuratively. The advent of technology facilitated Oehlen with a new medium through which to pursue his formalism. He began the series Computer Paintings after the purchase of his first Texas Instrument laptop in 1990. Having always produced art with a series of strict dictums in mind (for example, “paint slowly”), the computer was the perfect disciplinary vehicle through which Oehlen could progress onto the next phase of his artistic career. Admitting that upon beginning the computer collages “it was all extremely primitive”, he soon took immense pleasure in their “total typographical anarchy and chaotic content”. The limitations of early design programs prompted him to combine mediums, and he began using oil and acrylic paints to smooth out the highly pixelated lines by hand. Enlarged computer drawings and painted lines in the same image are not implemented to create an illusion, but to assure that two or three distinctive relationships come together in the work. Yet in Facedance (1996/2000), unlike previous computer-generated pieces, the painterly human touch through brushstroke is not evident, transforming the work into a wholly digitised endeavour. In response to overly solemn critics of the art world who attempt to analyse and brand his work, he coined the term “post-non-representational”. Admitting that he is no “big theory person”, when asked questions that demand serious statements, “[he] just makes it up”. Well into his fourth decade of painting, he is fully aware that there are restrictions in the capabilities of both abstraction and representation to denounce and extol the artistic tradition. Yet Oehlen revels in disunity, feeling no allegiances towards the accepted standards of what is “good painting”; he will simply continue to oppose long-standing customs in the name of the medium’s development.\n Download PDF.\nSelected Articles ARTUNER Curation | Open Source: Art at the Eclipse of Capitalism.\nSelected Exhibitions Private Collection, , Marciano Art Foundation, Los Angeles, United States, 2019.\nAlbert Oehlen, Serpentine Gallery, London, UK, 2019.\nsalondergegenwart, Salon der Gegenwart, Hamburg, Germany, 2019.\nPrivate Collection, Miettinen Collection | Salon Dahlmann, Berlin, Germany, 2019.\nFondation Louis Vuitton / The Collection: A Vision for Painting, Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, France, 2019.\nSammlung Unruh, Galerie Crone, Berlin, Germany, 2019.\nSOME TREES | ORGANIZED BY CHRISTIAN MALYCHA, NINO MIER GALLERY, Los Angeles, United States, 2019.\nHere's looking at you: modern and contemporary portraiture to fall in love with, Whitechapel Gallery, London, UK, 2019.\nALBERT OEHLEN | SPIEGELBILDER, Nahmad Contemporary, New York, United States, 2019.\nAlbert Oehlen: New Paintings, Gagosian, Hong Kong, 2019.\nCows by the Water: Albert Oehlen, Palazzo Grassi, Venice, Italy, 2018.\nSEXE, RELIGION, POLITIQUE, Gagosian, Paris, France, 2018.\nElevator Paintings: Trees, Gagosian West 21st Street, New York, NY, USA, 2017.\nAlbert Oehlen, Gagosian, Grosvenor Hill, London, UK, 2016.\nOpen Source: Art at the Eclipse of Capitalism, Galerie Max Hetzler (Berlin and Paris), Lisa Schiff, ARTUNER, 2015.\nVariations: Conversations in and Around Abstract Painting, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, LA, 2015.\nAlbert Oehlen: Home and Garden (forthcoming), New Musuem, New York , 2015.\nAlbert Oehlen, Galerie Max Hetzler, Paris, 2014.\nThe 5,000 Fingers of Doctor Ö., Museum Wiesbaden, Germany , 2014.\nRiotous Baroque, Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain, 2013.\nIl Palazzo Enciclopedico, 55th International Art Exhibition at the Venice Biennale, 2013.\nMalerei, Museum Moderner Kunst, Vienna , 2013.\nAlbert Oehlen, Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany , 2012.\nLooking Back for the Future, Kunsthalle Zürich, 2012.\nAlbert Oehlen, Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin, 2011.\nAlbert Oehlen, Emil Schumacher Museum, Hagen, Germany , 2010.\nAlbert Oehlen: Reality-Abstract, Musee d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris , 2009.\nI Will Always Champion Good/Bad Painting, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London , 2006.\nI Know Who You Showed Last Summer, Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami , 2005.\nAlbert Oehlen, Salzburger Kunstverein, Salzburg , 2004.\nAlbert Oehlen, Kunsthalle Basel , 1997.\nView all.\nAlbert Oehlen\non Artuner Albert Oehlen Untitled, 2008.\nAlbert Oehlen Untitled, 2001.\n× Sign Up for Our Newsletter Get exclusive insights from ARTUNER: - Invitations to ARTUNER Events \n- Special Exhibition Previews \n- Art world News Thanks!

{"id": 51, "data": "Sell with us. We are inviting consignment submissions for Albert Oehlen Submit Now.\nAlbert Oehlen.\nBiography Albert Oehlen is a German contemporary artist whose work explores the capabilities and failures of painting in the age of postmodernism. His deconstructed artworks reduce painting to a discordant mixture of its constituent elements—color, gesture, motion, and duration—and celebrate the resulting disharmony as an artistic expedition to the frontiers of the abilities of painting. Oehlen began his career in the art scenes of Cologne and Berlin, becoming associated with the Junge Wilde artists who sought to create works that defied classification and disrupted the artistic status quo. He has carried this sense of rebelliousness into his mature career with works that incorporate digital technologies as well as more traditional media. Oehlen’s paintings are marked by inherent, gleeful contradictions, always wielded with a cavalier confidence in the artist’s prowess – his uncooperative fusions of abstraction and figuration, for example, expose the inefficiencies of each art mode and explore the function of painting as much as its meaning. Oehlen has attracted critical praise befitting the innovative nature of his work, and he has been the subject of several major exhibitions at institutions such as the Mumok, Vienna and the New Museum, New York. He lives and works between Bühler, Switzerland. .\nRecent Albert Oehlen headlines, Powered by Articker 23 August 2021 | Hypebeast The Gagosian Is Showing Albert Oehlen’s “Tramonto Spaventoso” in Its Entirety.\n18 August 2021 | Art and Cake Gagosian Presents Albert Oehlen’s Tramonto Spaventoso at the Marciano Art Foundation.\n22 June 2021 | Dream Idea Machine ART CITIES:Los Angeles-Albert Oehlen, Part II.\n30 May 2021 | marylynnbuchanan.com Albert Oehlen at Gagosian.\n10 May 2021 | FAD Magazine Carroll Dunham | Albert Oehlen, a joint exhibition of paintings that explores the stylistic diversity of two of the most innovative painters of our time.\n Past Lots 16 Albert Oehlen Retrospektiv Estimate £1,100,000 - 1,500,000 Sold for  £1,353,500.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n32 Albert Oehlen Untitled Estimate £150,000 - 200,000 Sold for  £415,800.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n32 Albert Oehlen Control Estimate £400,000 - 600,000 Sold for  £475,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n34 Albert Oehlen Die Veränderungen Estimate £700,000 - 900,000 Sold for  £809,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n18 Albert Oehlen Im Museum II Estimate $600,000 - 800,000 Sold for  $560,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n17 Albert Oehlen Untitled Estimate $1,000,000 - 1,500,000 Sold for  $1,515,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n394 Albert Oehlen Untitled Estimate $20,000 - 30,000 Sold for  $32,500.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n16 Albert Oehlen Untitled Estimate £250,000 - 350,000 Sold for  £345,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n20 Albert Oehlen Omegasachen-35 Estimate £400,000 - 600,000 Sold for  £465,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n5 Albert Oehlen Untitled Estimate £400,000 - 600,000 Sold for  £729,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n9 Albert Oehlen La Playa Nueva Estimate £700,000 - 900,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n155 Albert Oehlen Untitled Estimate £30,000 - 50,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n156 Albert Oehlen Untitled Estimate £30,000 - 50,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n17 Albert Oehlen Abyss Estimate £1,000,000 - 1,500,000 Sold for  £2,165,000.\nShare Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn.\n125No Reserve Albert Oehlen Untitled;

{"id": 58, "data": "Albert Oehlen was born in Krefeld, Germany, in 1954. In Hamburg, he attended the Hochschule für Bildende Künste, where he studied Fine Arts from 1977 until 1981, and where Sigmar Polke was his professor. His first individual exhibition was held at Max Hetzler (Stuttgart) in 1981, under the title Bevor ihr malt, mach ich das lieber. In Oehlen’s works from this period, dark brown tones predominate, and his paintings represent interior spaces, cellars, apartments, and museums, always deserted. During the 80s, he began combining abstract and figurative elements, a trend that would culminate in his abstract paintings. In 1982, he began working with collage. In 1988, he moved to Andalusia for a year with his artist friend Martin Kippenberger, and then to Madrid. During this stage, he made his first drawings and paintings of trees. In 1990, during his stay in Los Angeles, he purchased a computer and began making drawings that, in 1992, would lead to his Computer Paintings, a series that he ended in 2008. In 1997, he began his grey paintings (a series that ended in 2008). Between 2000 and 2009, he was a painting professor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. In 2007, he began a new series of paintings, using advertising posters. After his visit to the exhibition Action Painting, held at the Fondation Beyeler de Riehen (Basel) in 2008, he began painting directly with his fingers (Fingermalerei). Today, he is still working on a series of paintings of trees that he had begun in 1989, as well as large-format collages. Albert Oehlen has exhibited in institutions and galleries of international renown, both in Europe and in the US A. His most recent exhibitions were held at Kunsthalle Vierseithof, Germany (2000); Kestner–Gesellschaft, Germany (2001); Musée d’Art moderne et contemporain of Strasbourg, France (2002); Salzburger Kunstverein, Austria (2004); Domus Artium, Salamanca (2002), and Musée Cantonale des Beaux Arts, Switzerland (2004) —traveling; Secession, Viena (2004); FRAC Auvergne—Ecuries de Chazerat, Clermont–Ferrand, France (2005); Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami (2005)—the artist’s first large monographic exhibition in the USA; Whitechapel Gallery, London (2006); Museo di Capodimonte, Italy (2009); Musée d’Art moderne de la Ville de Paris (2009); Emil Schumacher Museum, Germany (2010); Sammlung Grässlin, Germany (2010); Carré Musée d’art contemporain de Nîmes, France (2011); Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany (2012); Museum Moderner Kunst, Vienna (2013); Museum Wiesbaden, Germany (2014); New Museum, New York (2015); Kunsthalle Zürich (2015); The Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland (2016); and now the current exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2016). The artist’s work was also included in the Venice Biennial of 2013.

X.\nPortrait Albert Oehlen Source Code and Stress Test by Daniel Baumann.\nLike almost no other artist, Albert Oehlen subjects painting to a stress test. For over 30 years he’s been tinkering with the medium’s source code: colour and paint application, lines and layers, titles and triumphs, disappointments and expectations. These elements are all played against one another and caught off guard. Daniel Baumann leads us through the work. Networks were invented to facilitate communication between dissimilar systems, the media theorist, artist, and programmer Alexander R. Galloway wrote in Spike #39. One could say that art has an analogous function: it develops its meaning as a network linking thinking and life. What particularly struck me about Galloway’s article, however, was his description of software as existing in three distinct modes: source code, executable code, and interface. This got me thinking that the majority of so-called post-Internet art barely ever goes beyond the interface – that is, beyond a desktop-like appearance. This would explain why such art is always immediately recognizable even though it comes in many different forms: it is an art of the surface. Among the huge array of objects, texts, painted-over prints, and distorted scans, one can indeed find works that deal with source code and contend with the depths it involves. But it’s not so easy to tell them apart from all the rest. Similarly, at the beginning of the 1980s, it wasn’t immediately apparent how and why Albert Oehlen’s paintings were so different from the “wild” Neo-Expressionism that was everywhere at the time. Leafing through the catalogues and books focusing on German art from this era, one finds images of Oehlen’s work alongside paintings by Elvira Bach, Werner Büttner, Walter Dahn, Martin Disler, Georg Herold, Martin Kippenberger, Helmut Middendorf, Markus Oehlen, Salomé, Klaudia Schifferle, and Andreas Schulze – and the difference is not always so obvious. _______INSERT_______ Yet it would have been possible quite early on to see that Oehlen’s concerns lay elsewhere. Initial clues were offered by the titles of his paintings: among them Gegen den Liberalismus (Against Liberalism, 1980); Morgenlicht fällt ins Führerhauptquartier (Morning Light Falls in the Führer’s Headquarters, 1982); Treppenhaus Spezial (Staircase Special, 1984); and Selbstporträt mit verschissener Unterhose und blauer Mauritius (Self-Portrait with Shitty Underpants and Blue Mauritius, 1984). There is no mode of painting that can cover such a wide range of themes and non-themes, but that was exactly the point. Like Büttner and Kippenberger, or above all Sigmar Polke, Oehlen used such statements to push the subject matter and imagery of painting to the limits of its potential, as a way of demystifying the medium, undermining expectations and, ultimately, liberating art from the mission it was purported to have by collectors, institutions, and admirers of artists like Joseph Beuys or Anselm Kiefer. “So, what you had to do was to put an excessive amount of stress on the medium [painting], that’s how the real beauty comes out,” Oehlen explained in a 1991 conversation with Wilfried Dickhoff and the Austrian linguist Martin Prinzhorn, who was among the first to participate in the discussion of this strategy of making excessive demands. In the exhibition catalogue for a show at Galerie Borgmann Capitain in Cologne in 1986, Prinzhorn gives an accurate description of how Oehlen’s art resists any simple meaning being ascribed to it: “For art criticism, that old game of allocating form and content is always central. No matter how complex it might be, it ultimately always aims at a form of ‘understanding’ that presupposes such an endeavour as a meaningful allegory or metaphor. The art we are discussing here does not allow for these kinds of interpretative mechanisms.” _______INSERT_______ As recently as 2005, American curator Bonnie Clearwater wrote: “Albert Oehlen is a difficult artist to pin down. This is deliberate on his part.” To this day, most of the writing on Oehlen is an attempt to do just that. This endeavour is confronted by a body of work that exploits contradictions and assimilates them into its underlying structure. In addition, attempts to domesticate Oehlen’s work are made more difficult by the artist himself staking out a position in his writings and giving numerous interviews that turn commonly held ideas upside-down. Until 1987, Oehlen made figurative paintings that didn’t differentiate between the sincere and the banal and primarily worked with a spectrum of greys and browns. In 1984 he introduced the three primary colours, blue, red, and yellow, as if the point were to think back to Mondrian. This is when he painted Portrait A.H. (1984), a large-format portrait of Adolf Hitler in primary colours – which still seems borderline today. Also around this time, Oehlen began experimenting with elements foreign to painting proper, incorporating stickers, metal signs, and above all mirrors into his paintings. He opened up the closed space of the canvas using the most banal means possible. In this way, Oehlen’s work feigns a conceptual approach that ostensibly provides an easy point of entry for people doubtful of painting’s value. Finally, in 1987, Oehlen produced a series of figurative works, each of which was titled Abstract Painting. What was originally intended as a dig at the traditional opposition of figuration and abstraction became a long-term engagement with abstract painting – insofar as this is still a valid term. Oehlen claims that his behaviour and artistic practice as a young artist were also an attempt to break into the temple of painting. In 1988, something went missing as part of this process and hasn’t returned since: perspective. Kippenberger’s 1986 exhibition “Die Perspektivenscheisse” (The Perspective-Shit) at Gerald Just in Hannover already signalled that something was in the air. In 1989, the same year as the fall of the Berlin Wall, many people did indeed lose perspective. In Oehlen’s case, it was replaced with layering: the pictorial space, which had previously been structured hierarchically with foreground, middle ground, and background, began to spread across the picture plane and stack up in multiple layers. This gave a new prominence to colour as a material as well as to the role of line. _______INSERT_______ In 1991 Oehlen began making drawings on the computer without knowing too much about the technical details. The resulting images were printed out, silkscreened onto large canvases, and worked on some more with paint. The computer-drawn lines became monumental, raising questions around the nature of materiality. While the digital offers no resistance and can be modified at will, paint insists on a life of its own: its sheen varies, depending on the way the light falls; it drips or is too matte or thick in all the wrong places. There is a certain arrogance to its materiality – a quality foreign to the digital, which is so endlessly compliant. In the following years, Oehlen conducted further experiments with the digital, working through various possibilities for drawing and colour, and creating invitation cards and posters that look as if Photoshop were having a bad dream. Oehlen then continued to broaden his territory, especially in the late 90s, with a series of grey paintings in which he adopts Gerhard Richter’s famous blurring technique. As in Richter’s works, this process resulted in images that both suggested a lot of associations and were formally elegant. One might think that such an effect is inevitable: blurry grey is always a big hit. This would seem to support Walter Robinson’s theory of “zombie formalism”, which claims that contemporary painting is dominated by work that refers in more or less covert ways to art (like the work of Christopher Wool or Albert Oehlen) that is well established on the market. _______INSERT_______ After the turn of the millennium, Oehlen’s practice expanded at an even faster pace. This period saw the emergence of collage, such as that shown at the Vienna Secession in 2004; collage on paintings, as shown at Galerie Max Hetzler in Berlin in 2011; paintings on collage, as shown at Gagosian in New York in 2014. He has also made large pictures by gluing advertising posters on top of one another; finger paintings; large charcoal drawings; and, since 2014, paintings on aluminium Dibond that depict the dark silhouettes of trees against a red and white background. Trees first appeared in Oehlen’s work in the late 80s; now, 25 years later, they have been given their own extensive series. According to Oehlen, the tree works well as a form because it is both abstract and figurative, while allowing for flatness and depth, detail and mass, density and line. As a structure, it engenders connections through the image, as well as obscuring it and partitioning it. And it is powerful enough to hold its own against the layers of red and white. These paintings have a somewhat monstrous quality. They are astonishingly cold and harsh, and leave a striking impression of irreconcilability. The details are fantastic: the matteness, the sheen, the brushstrokes, the fade-to-white, the traces of glue, the spray paint particles, the lines. Above all: the lines. If anything, these lines are the content of Oehlen’s work. They invite the viewer to look closely, to study the application of paint, the edges, sections, and progressions. Standing in front of an Oehlen painting is like standing in front of an idea. These paintings cancel out the division between form and content, figuration and abstraction. Whether they are good or bad or wrong, they are aware of their particular depth, but it has nothing to do with perspective. Instead it has everything to do with the details – they are the source code from which the image is produced, which is also what breaks down the system of painting. It’s in the details that a space opens up, space that is also time – the time one takes to look, without ever being seduced, without ever being instructed, without ever being tickled by tricks, without having to love. For me, these paintings bring to mind Jean-Luc Godard’s recent films, which have a sense of distance that is hard to match. These pictures are like an Internet protocol that enables the very possibility of exchange. Translated by Bonnie Begusch  ALBERT OEHLEN, born 1954 in Krefeld, lives in Switzerland.

Executed in a palette that contrasts organic greens, yellows, dun and russet with intense black, gleaming white and a shock of violet, the work offers an extraordinary panoply of painterly textures: from feverish furls to smooth brown curves, from rapid, dashed lines to a tranquil patch of settled white. Untitled stems from 1989: the year after Oehlen’s pivotal sojourn in Andalusia with his close friend and fellow painter Martin Kippenberger. During this period, the artist broke with his early figurative idiom and launched into the unique abstract mode that has animated much of his oeuvre since. ‘Spain,’ Oehlen has explained, ‘was extremely productive … For me it was the start of my abstract paintings, a radical revolution in my painting, the decisive step in my development’ (A. Oehlen, quoted in S. Kippenberger, Kippenberger: The Artist and his Families , Berlin 2007, p. 343). Cerebral yet spontaneous, a master of both expressivity and exactitude, Oehlen conceived his oeuvre as a ceaseless voyager through the outer reaches of his medium. The present work’s intersection of colours and textures create a tableau of constant flux, as if it not yet fixed in its final formation. Oehlen has called his style ‘post-non-representational,’ betokening a move away from the entirely abstract work of postwar American painters such as Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock. Indeed, Untitled contains some intimations of figuration. There is, for instance, a string of black orbs on the central right area of the canvas; on the left side there are black lines that appear almost to be the edges of a discrete object. Oehlen refuses to grant these features concrete signification, allowing them to remain enigmatic, the forms they might represent neither present or not present. As the curator Hamza Walker describes them, Oehlen’s canvases are ‘a chorus of contradictory gestures; figuration is set against abstraction, form against anti-form, the rhythm of pattern versus a meandering stroke, and a muddy mix of colours juxtaposed against vibrant pigment straight from the tube’ (H. Walker, ‘The Good, the Bad, the Ugly’, in Albert Oehlen: Recent Paintings , exh. cat., The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, Chicago, 1995, http:// renaissancesociety.org/publishing/90/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly [accessed 31 August 2018]). Untitled ’s explosive cacophony of paint encapsulates this approach. Its chaotic arrangement and diversity of concept draws attention to the process of painting itself, turning Oehlen’s adrift application into its subject matter. ‘For me,’ he says, ‘painting is about trying to get as far away from meaning as possible, which is perhaps the most difficult thing of all. Really, I am just trying to make something new every time’ (A. Oehlen, quoted in S. O’Hagan, ‘Albert Oehlen, There’s something hysterical about magenta’, The Guardian, 5 Feb 2016). An outstanding example of the artist’s practice at a crucial juncture in his career, the present work succeeds in these aims with assurance.\nMore from                             Post War and Contemporary Art Evening Auction View All.\nView All \n", "label": [[8, 21, "ARTIST"], [26, 30, "DATE"], [32, 40, "WORK_OF_ART"], [100, 104, "DATE"], [117, 136, "GALLERY"], [138, 144, "GPE"], [146, 165, "GALLERY"], [167, 173, "GPE"], [195, 201, "GPE"], [215, 224, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [225, 231, "GPE"], [233, 248, "DATE"], [341, 354, "ARTIST"], [357, 364, "GPE"], [365, 369, "DATE"], [464, 477, "ARTIST"], [480, 484, "DATE"], [578, 582, "DATE"], [804, 820, "ARTIST"], [858, 862, "DATE"], [875, 880, "GPE"], [1033, 1046, "ARTIST"], [1076, 1089, "ARTIST"], [1092, 1100, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1499, 1507, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1519, 1523, "DATE"], [1540, 1547, "ARTIST"], [1568, 1577, "GPE"], [1619, 1638, "ARTIST"], [1797, 1802, "GPE"], [1805, 1811, "ARTIST"], [1980, 1989, "ARTIST"], [2001, 2030, "GPE"], [2062, 2068, "GPE"], [2069, 2073, "DATE"], [2156, 2162, "ARTIST"], [2386, 2392, "ARTIST"], [2535, 2546, "ARTIST"], [2551, 2566, "ARTIST"], [2576, 2584, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2810, 2816, "ARTIST"], [2986, 2998, "CURATOR"], [3015, 3021, "ARTIST"], [3274, 3283, "CURATOR"], [3319, 3332, "ARTIST"], [3334, 3350, "EVENT"], [3418, 3425, "GPE"], [3427, 3431, "DATE"], [3514, 3528, "DATE"], [3532, 3540, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3709, 3715, "ARTIST"], [3962, 3971, "ARTIST"], [3996, 4009, "ARTIST"], [4070, 4080, "DATE"]]}
{"id": 63, "data": "Warning! The template for this page [TurismoCultura.html] doesn't exists. Museum of Capodimonte \"Albert Oehlen\" For the first time in an Italian museum, the works of Albert Oehlen will be presented at the Museum of Capodimonte.\nThe artist will present a collection of his new work which reflect the latest results of his research following his constant exploration of the methods and the meaning itself of painting.\n\"Albert Oehlen developed a way to treat the language of art in order to take it outside of its own semantic needs. He has always understood how to construct observation or auditory space without cross-references through design, color, two-dimensional or plastic forms, with an internal echo which defines the autonomy of the creation meant as a combinatory and paradoxically tautological gesture.\" (A. Bonito Oliva)\nThe desire for \"emotions\", intended as the \"effects\" of art on our souls and, at the same time, the desire to revive Pop Art, have caused Oehlen to experiment with elements such as color, clarity and vivacity. In his latest works, the German artist places publicity posters on the canvas and then intervenes upon both with oil paints. The result is an abstract painting that has an innate irritability caused by the \"intruding\" publicity. Fascinated by the increasingly \"sophisticated\" nature of this publicity, Oehlen introduces them into his works to demonstrate various motifs without having to introduce a specific context, a declaration of their content. The basic concept is beauty, a different type of exploration of approach and method, just as it is for Abstract Art, where the elements of the painting are not connected but become pure form. Each of these can have meaning and can produce different \"effects\" or emotions which are separate from the context in which they are contained.\n\"The result is a map showing a geography of open pathways without a center or periphery, with a movement toward a viewing without stopping points, carried and stimulated above all toward the progressive and reversible changes. If beauty is a coin of nature which needs to be circulated, as Rilke said, and if art is the production of beauty, then Oehlen reinforces this possibility through the production of images that adopt the support of posters, the ultimate commercialized emblems, in order to produce a short circuit with his sign systems with which he underlines, concentrates, condenses and erases.\" (A.

Beginning in 1922, he lived and worked mainly in Paris but regularly visited his hometown Borgonovo to see his family and work on his art. Giacometti was one of the most important sculptors of the 20th century. His work was particularly influenced by artistic styles such as Cubism and Surrealism. Philosophical questions about the human condition, as well as existential and phenomenological debates played a significant role in his work.[5] Around 1935 he gave up on his Surrealist influences in order to pursue a more deepened analysis of figurative compositions. Giacometti wrote texts for periodicals and exhibition catalogues and recorded his thoughts and memories in notebooks and diaries. His critical nature led to self-doubt about his own work and his self-perceived inability to do justice to his own artistic vision. His insecurities nevertheless remained a powerful motivating artistic force throughout his entire life.[6] Between 1938 and 1944 Giacometti's sculptures had a maximum height of seven centimeters (2.75 inches).[7] Their small size reflected the actual distance between the artist's position and his model. In this context he self-critically stated: \"But wanting to create from memory what I had seen, to my terror the sculptures became smaller and smaller\".[8] After World War II, Giacometti created his most famous sculptures: his extremely tall and slender figurines. These sculptures were subject to his individual viewing experience—between an imaginary yet real, a tangible yet inaccessible space.[9] In Giacometti's whole body of work, his painting constitutes only a small part. After 1957, however, his figurative paintings were equally as present as his sculptures. The almost monochrome paintings of his late work do not refer to any other artistic styles of modernity.[10] Contents 1 Early life.\n2 Career.\n3 Later years.\n4 Death.\n5 Artistic analysis.\n5.1 Walking Man and other human figures.\n6 Legacy.\n6.1 Exhibitions.\n6.2 Public collections.\n6.3 Art foundations.\n6.4 Notable sales.\n6.5 Other legacy.\n7 References.\n7.1 Citations.\n7.2 General sources.\n8 Further reading.\n9 External links.\nEarly life[edit] Alberto Giacometti at the 31° Venice Biennale in 1962, photographed by Paolo Monti (Fondo Paolo Monti, BEIC ).\nGiacometti was born in Borgonovo, Switzerland, the eldest of four children of Giovanni Giacometti, a well-known post-Impressionist painter, and Annetta Giacometti-Stampa. He was a descendant of Protestant refugees escaping the inquisition. Coming from an artistic background, he was interested in art from an early age. Alberto attended the Geneva School of Fine Arts. His brothers Diego (1902–1985) and Bruno (1907–2012) would go on to become artists and architects as well. Additionally, his cousin Zaccaria Giacometti, later professor of constitutional law and chancellor of the University of Zurich, grew up together with them, having been orphaned at the age of 12 in 1905.[11] Career[edit] In 1922, he moved to Paris to study under the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, an associate of Rodin. It was there that Giacometti experimented with Cubism and Surrealism and came to be regarded as one of the leading Surrealist sculptors. Among his associates were Miró, Max Ernst, Picasso, Bror Hjorth, and Balthus. Between 1936 and 1940, Giacometti concentrated his sculpting on the human head, focusing on the sitter's gaze. He preferred models he was close to—his sister and the artist Isabel Rawsthorne (then known as Isabel Delmer).[12] This was followed by a phase in which his statues of Isabel became stretched out; her limbs elongated.[13] Obsessed with creating his sculptures exactly as he envisioned through his unique view of reality, he often carved until they were as thin as nails and reduced to the size of a pack of cigarettes, much to his consternation. A friend of his once said that if Giacometti decided to sculpt you, \"he would make your head look like the blade of a knife\". During World War II, Giacometti took refuge in Switzerland. There, in 1946, he met Annette Arm, a secretary for the Red Cross. They married in 1949.[14] After his marriage his tiny sculptures became larger, but the larger they grew, the thinner they became. For the remainder of Giacometti's life, Annette was his main female model.[14] His paintings underwent a parallel procedure. The figures appear isolated and severely attenuated, as the result of continuous reworking. He frequently revisited his subjects: one of his favourite models was his younger brother Diego.[15] Later years[edit] Cat , 1954, Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nIn 1958 Giacometti was asked to create a monumental sculpture for the Chase Manhattan Bank building in New York, which was beginning construction. Although he had for many years \"harbored an ambition to create work for a public square\",[16] he \"had never set foot in New York, and knew nothing about life in a rapidly evolving metropolis. Nor had he ever laid eyes on an actual skyscraper\", according to his biographer James Lord.[17] Giacometti's work on the project resulted in the four figures of standing women—his largest sculptures—entitled Grande femme debout I through IV (1960). The commission was never completed, however, because Giacometti was unsatisfied by the relationship between the sculpture and the site, and abandoned the project. In 1962, Giacometti was awarded the grand prize for sculpture at the Venice Biennale, and the award brought with it worldwide fame. Even when he had achieved popularity and his work was in demand, he still reworked models, often destroying them or setting them aside to be returned to years later. The prints produced by Giacometti are often overlooked but the catalogue raisonné, Giacometti – The Complete Graphics and 15 Drawings by Herbert Lust (Tudor 1970), comments on their impact and gives details of the number of copies of each print. Some of his most important images were in editions of only 30 and many were described as rare in 1970. In his later years Giacometti's works were shown in a number of large exhibitions throughout Europe. Riding a wave of international popularity, and despite his declining health, he traveled to the United States in 1965 for an exhibition of his works at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. As his last work he prepared the text for the book Paris sans fin, a sequence of 150 lithographs containing memories of all the places where he had lived. Death[edit] 100 Swiss franc banknote 1998–2019, front.\n100 Swiss franc banknote, back.\nGiacometti died in 1966 of heart disease (pericarditis) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease at the Kantonsspital in Chur, Switzerland. His body was returned to his birthplace in Borgonovo, where he was interred close to his parents. With no children, Annette Giacometti became the sole holder of his property rights.[14] She worked to collect a full listing of authenticated works by her late husband, gathering documentation on the location and manufacture of his works and working to fight the rising number of counterfeited works. When she died in 1993, the Fondation Giacometti was set up by the French state. In May 2007 the executor of his widow's estate, former French foreign minister Roland Dumas, was convicted of illegally selling Giacometti's works to a top auctioneer, Jacques Tajan, who was also convicted. Both were ordered to pay €850,000 to the Alberto and Annette Giacometti Foundation.[18] Artistic analysis[edit] Alberto Giacometti Photo by Henri Cartier-Bresson.\nRegarding Giacometti's sculptural technique and according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art: \"The rough, eroded, heavily worked surfaces of Three Men Walking (II), 1949, typify his technique. Reduced, as they are, to their very core, these figures evoke lone trees in winter that have lost their foliage. Within this style, Giacometti would rarely deviate from the three themes that preoccupied him—the walking man; the standing, nude woman; and the bust—or all three, combined in various groupings.\"[19] In a letter to Pierre Matisse, Giacometti wrote: \"Figures were never a compact mass but like a transparent construction\".[20]   In the letter, Giacometti writes about how he looked back at the realist, classical busts of his youth with nostalgia, and tells the story of the existential crisis which precipitated the style he became known for. \"[I rediscovered] the wish to make compositions with figures. For this I had to make (quickly I thought; in passing), one or two studies from nature, just enough to understand the construction of a head, of a whole figure, and in 1935 I took a model. This study should take, I thought, two weeks and then I could realize my compositions...I worked with the model all day from 1935 to 1940...Nothing was as I imagined.  A head, became for me an object completely unknown and without dimensions.\"[20] Since Giacometti achieved exquisite realism with facility when he was executing busts in his early adolescence, Giacometti's difficulty in re-approaching the figure as an adult is generally understood as a sign of existential struggle for meaning, rather than as a technical deficit. Giacometti was a key player in the Surrealist art movement, but his work resists easy categorization. Some describe it as formalist, others argue it is expressionist or otherwise having to do with what Deleuze calls \"blocs of sensation\" (as in Deleuze's analysis of Francis Bacon). Even after his excommunication from the Surrealist group, while the intention of his sculpting was usually imitation, the end products were an expression of his emotional response to the subject. He attempted to create renditions of his models the way he saw them, and the way he thought they ought to be seen. He once said that he was sculpting not the human figure but \"the shadow that is cast\". Scholar William Barrett in Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy (1962), argues that the attenuated forms of Giacometti's figures reflect the view of 20th century modernism and existentialism that modern life is increasingly empty and devoid of meaning. \"All the sculptures of today, like those of the past, will end one day in pieces...So it is important to fashion one's work carefully in its smallest recess and charge every particle of matter with life.\" A 2011–2012 exhibition at the Pinacothèque de Paris focused on showing how Giacometti was inspired by Etruscan art.[21] Artworks by Giacometti at the 31st Venice Biennale in 1962, photographed by Paolo Monti.\nWalking Man and other human figures[edit] Giacometti is best known for the bronze sculptures of tall, thin human figures, made in the years 1945 to 1960.[22] Giacometti was influenced by the impressions he took from the people hurrying in the big city. People in motion he saw as \"a succession of moments of stillness\".[23] The emaciated figures are often interpreted as an expression of the existential fear, insignificance and loneliness of mankind.[24] The mood of fear in the period of the 1940s and the Cold War is reflected in this figure. It feels sad, lonely and difficult to relate to.[25] Legacy[edit] Exhibitions[edit] Giacometti's work has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions including the High Museum of Art, Atlanta (1970); Centre Pompidou, Paris (2007–2008); Pushkin Museum, Moscow \"The Studio of Alberto Giacometti: Collection of the Fondation Alberto et Annette Giacometti\" (2008);  Kunsthal Rotterdam (2008); Fondation Beyeler, Basel (2009);  Buenos Aires (2012); Kunsthalle Hamburg (2013); Pera Museum, Istanbul (2015); Tate Modern, London (2017);[26] Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver BC \"Alberto Giacometti: A Line Through Time\" (2019).[27] The National Portrait Gallery, London's first solo exhibition of Giacometti's work, Pure Presence opened to five star reviews on 13 October 2015 (to 10 January 2016, in honour of the fiftieth anniversary of the artist's death).[28][29]\nFrom April 2019, the Prado Museum in Madrid, has been highlighting Giacometti in an exhibition.

A public interest institution, the Foundation was created in 2003 and aims at promoting, disseminating, preserving and protecting Alberto Giacometti's work. The Alberto-Giacometti-Stiftung[33] established in Zürich in 1965, holds a smaller collection of works acquired from the collection of the Pittsburgh industrialist G. David Thompson. Notable sales[edit] According to record Giacometti has sold the two most expensive sculptures in history. In November 2000 a Giacometti bronze, Grande Femme Debout I, sold for $14.3 million.[34] Grande Femme Debout II was bought by the Gagosian Gallery for $27.4 million at Christie's auction in New York City on 6 May 2008.[35] L'Homme qui marche I, a life-sized bronze sculpture of a man, became one of the most expensive works of art, and at the time was the most expensive sculpture ever sold at auction. It was in February 2010, when it sold for £65 million (US$104.3 million) at Sotheby's, London.[36][37] Grande tête mince, a large bronze bust, sold for $53.3 million just three months later. L'Homme au doigt (Pointing Man) sold for $126 million (£81,314,455.32), or $141.3 million with fees, in Christie's May 2015, \"Looking Forward to the Past\" sale in New York City. The work had been in the same private collection for 45 years.[38] As of now it is the most expensive sculpture sold at auction. After being showcased on the BBC programme Fake or Fortune, a plaster sculpture, titled Gazing Head, sold in 2019 for half a million pounds.[39] In April 2021, Giacometti's small-scale bronze sculpture, Nu debout II (1953), was sold from a Japanese private collection and went for £1.5 million ($2 million), against an estimate of £800,000 ($1.1 million).[40] Other legacy[edit] Giacometti created the monument on the grave of Gerda Taro at Père Lachaise Cemetery.[41] In 2001 he was included in the Painting the Century: 101 Portrait Masterpieces 1900–2000 exhibition held at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Giacometti and his sculpture L'Homme qui marche I appear on the former 100 Swiss franc banknote.[42] According to a lecture by Michael Peppiatt at Cambridge University on 8 July 2010, Giacometti, who had a friendship with author/playwright Samuel Beckett, created a tree for the set of a 1961 Paris production of Waiting for Godot. The Giacometti in Louisiana, Copenhagen is mentioned in Film 27 (Season Three) of Wallander (Swedish TV series) The 2017 movie Final Portrait retells the story of his friendship with the biographer James Lord. Giacometti is played by Geoffrey Rush. References[edit] Citations[edit] ^ \"Giacometti, Alberto\" . Lexico UK English Dictionary . Oxford University Press . n.d .

Alberto Giacometti 1901, Borgonovo, Switzerland — 1966, Coira, Switzerland.\nShare Alberto Giacometti was born October 10, 1901, in Borgonovo, Switzerland, and grew up in the nearby town of Stampa. His father, Giovanni, was a Post-Impressionist painter. From 1919 to 1920, he studied painting at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and sculpture and drawing at the Ecole des Arts et Métiers in Geneva. In 1920, he traveled to Italy, where he was impressed by the works of Alexander Archipenko and Paul Cézanne at the Venice Biennale. He was also deeply affected by African and Egyptian art and by the masterpieces of Giotto and Tintoretto. In 1922, Giacometti settled in Paris, where he occasionally attended Antoine Bourdelle’s sculpture classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. In 1927, the artist moved into a studio with his brother, Diego, his lifelong companion and assistant, and exhibited his sculpture for the first time at the Salon des Tuileries, Paris. His first show in Switzerland, shared with his father, was held at the Galerie Aktuaryus, Zurich, in 1927. The following year, Giacometti met André Masson, and by 1930 he was a participant in the Surrealist circle until 1934. His first solo show took place in 1932 at the Galerie Pierre Colle, Paris. In 1934, his first American solo exhibition opened at the Julien Levy Gallery, New York. During the early 1940s, he became friends with Simone de Beauvoir, Pablo Picasso, and Jean-Paul Sartre. From 1942, Giacometti lived in Geneva, where he associated with the publisher Albert Skira. He exhibited in New York, at the Peggy Guggenheim’s museum/gallery, Art of This Century, in 1945. He returned to Paris in 1946. In 1948, he was given a solo show at the Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York. The artist’s friendship with Samuel Beckett began around 1951. In 1955, he was honored with retrospectives at the Arts Council Gallery, London, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. He received the Sculpture Prize at the 1961 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh and the Grand Prize for Sculpture at the 1962 Venice Biennale, where he was given his own exhibition area. In 1965, Giacometti exhibitions were organized by the Tate Gallery, London, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Louisiana Museum, Humlebaek, Denmark, and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. That same year, he was awarded the Grand Prix National des Arts by the French government.

His work has been compared to that of the existentialists in literature. Giacometti displayed precocious talent and was much encouraged by his father, Giovanni, a Post-Impressionist painter, and by his godfather, Cuno Amiet, a Fauvist painter. He spent a happy childhood in the village of Stampa, to which he returned regularly until his death. He grew up among brothers who also showed a penchant for the arts. His brother Diego became known as a furniture designer and served as Giacometti’s model and aide. Another brother, Bruno, became an architect.

After a time in Venice and Padua (May 1920), he went to Florence and Rome (fall 1920–summer 1921), where he encountered rich collections of Egyptian art. The stylized and fixed, yet striding, figures with their steady gazes proved to have a lasting impact on his art. Between 1922 and 1925 Giacometti studied at the Académie de la Grande-Chaumière in Paris. Although he owed much to his teacher, Émile-Antoine Bourdelle, his style was very different. It was related to the Cubist sculpture of Alexander Archipenko and Raymond Duchamp-Villon and to the Post-Cubist sculpture of Henri Laurens and Jacques Lipchitz. In Torso (1925), for example, Giacometti merged the Classical tradition with the avant-garde and reduced the human body to a grouping of geometric shapes which, together, capture the contrapposto posture. He was also inspired by African and Oceanic art—as in The Spoon-Woman (1926), in which the figure’s torso takes on the shape of a ceremonial spoon. It was his flat slablike sculptures, however, such as Observing Head (1927/28), that soon made him popular among the Paris avant-garde. Having abandoned any resemblance to realism in his work during the period 1925–29, he continued the abstraction trend in the period 1930–32, but he began working in a distinctly Surrealist fashion as well, attempting to express unconscious desires in erotically charged works such as Suspended Ball and The Palace at 4 A.M. In 1933–34, still working with Surrealism, Giacometti—whose beloved father had died in 1933—attempted metaphorical compositions using the themes of life and death in Hands Holding the Void (Invisible Object) and 1 + 1 = 3. Giacometti lamented that his serious works of art had as little reference to reality as the merely decorative vases and lamps that he made to earn a living. Hands Holding the Void (Invisible Object) (1934), with its clear, though stylized, female form, already shows his interest in moving toward realism. After an acrimonious break with the Surrealist group in 1935, he began to work after nature again. What had started as mere studies became a lifelong pursuit: the phenomenological approach to reality—that is, the search for the given reality in what one sees when one is looking at a person. In June 1940, to escape the Nazi invasion, Giacometti and his brother Diego left Paris by bicycle and traveled to the south of France. They stayed there briefly and returned to Paris only to flee again in 1941 to Geneva, where they remained until 1946. During that tumultuous time, Giacometti arrived at matchstick-sized, coarsely textured sculptures of figures and heads that are so small that they appear far away in space. About 1947 he began to express his massless, weightless image of reality in a skeletal style, with figures thin as beanstalks. His new style projected an air of despair and loneliness. The frail scarred bodies he created reflected those of the survivors living in postwar Paris. Suddenly, Giacometti enjoyed a rapid rise to fame, especially in the United States, through two exhibitions (1948 and 1950) at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York City and an essay on his art by the French existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who described the artist and his work within the context of the existentialist worldview. Giacometti continued to question his artistic path and search for ways to challenge—or equal—reality in sculpture as well as in painting. For him an artwork was to become an almost magical evocation of reality in an imaginary space, as in heads of Diego and figures after his wife Annette (1952–58), executed like apparitions as both paintings and sculptures. His portraits of Caroline or Elie Lotar, his models and friends in the last years (1958–65), are heads and busts gazing intently and made only with lines of force, without contour lines or surfaces. At that point he felt that reality was no longer dependent on being perceived by someone; reality simply was. Like the characters in Samuel Beckett’s novels and plays, Giacometti’s figures represented an isolated, highly individualistic worldview. In 1961 Beckett, his longtime friend and confidant, asked Giacometti to design a set for his absurdist drama Waiting for Godot (published 1953). The final design consisted of a single plaster tree. Giacometti was one of the outstanding artists of the 20th century. At a time when avant-garde artists aimed at rendering nonfigurative or expressive qualities rather than achieving resemblance to reality, he worked for the unattainable goal of equaling reality by rendering a portrait—whether drawing, painting, or sculpture—so that it would be perceived by the spectator with the impact it would have were it a living person. To do this he introduced into the art of sculpture a new concept of rendering distance. Massless and weightless, his figures and heads are immediately seen from a specific frontal point of view and therefore perceived as situated in distance and space. Giacometti had such intellectual integrity—for example, living in a shabby studio in Montparnasse even after fame and fortune had reached him—that he became for his contemporaries, especially those of the postwar generation, an almost legendary figure during his lifetime.\n Reinhold D.

Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that Giacometti’s depictions of humanity are “always mediating between nothingness and being,” his sculptures evoking the emotional intensity of the void. Often considered testimony to the ravages of postwar Europe, Giacometti’s sculptures, paintings, and drawings possess a timeless quality, inflected with art historical and philosophical narratives, from Surrealism and Expressionism to existentialism and phenomenology. Born near Stampa, in Switzerland’s southeastern Alps, Giacometti grew up surrounded by the dark shadows, glistening lakes, and precipitous roads of the steep mountain range. This geographic intensity would deeply inform his understanding of mortality and time. In 1922 Giacometti moved to Paris, where, growing dissatisfied with his figurative sculptures, he turned to Cubism, dissecting abstract forms and experimenting with negative space. His search for noncorporeal sculptural forms led to planar, abstract works such as Gazing Head (1928), shown in an exhibition at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher in June 1929. This work caught the attention of the Surrealists, whose thinking would influence the form and content of Giacometti’s work, and expanded the ways he approached themes of destruction, materiality, and the uncanny. Giacometti often used his close companions as models, from his wife Annette to his brother Diego, as well as poets, writers, and fellow artists including Jean Genet and Eli Lotar, requiring them to sit for many hours—often over several weeks—to capture their likeness to his satisfaction. During these long periods of stillness, he would insist that his sitters offer him a presence as attentive as his own. In the 1950s, beginning with his second exhibition at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York, Giacometti started to gain international acclaim as critics, writers, and philosophers recognized his work as an absolute embodiment of his generation. During this period the artist was particularly focused on representations of the female nude, depicting slender, elegiac forms that emphasize the relationship between the body and gravity. Giacometti produced his famed Femmes de Venise (Women of Venice, 1956) for the French Pavilion of the 1956 Venice Biennale, as well as a concurrent retrospective at the Kunsthalle Bern. Sculpting clay over wire armatures, he created around fifteen figures, nine of which were cast in bronze. Departing from his earlier, impossibly thin “visionary” figures, the Femmes de Venise are rendered with a lifelike accuracy, their somber elegance speaking to universal themes of life and death, darkness and light. Up until his death in 1966, Giacometti pushed the limits of representation, setting into motion ever-unfolding phenomenological investigations that remain at the core of art making today: How can matter—bronze, plaster, charcoal, paint—embody truth? And how, if at all, can art preserve the essence of the living?.\nPhoto: Gordon Parks/Getty Images #AlbertoGiacometti Facebook Twitter E-mail.\nDownloads Selected exhibition history (PDF)\nSelected bibliography (PDF).\nWebsite fondation-giacometti.fr.\nExhibitions Bustes de Femmes\n            \nParis 10th Anniversary Exhibition October 10–December 18, 2020 rue de Ponthieu, Paris.\nSubstance and Shadow\n            \nAlberto Giacometti sculptures and their photographs by Peter Lindbergh May 19–July 22, 2017 Britannia Street, London.\nExtended through November 19, 2016 Nude\n            \nFrom Modigliani to Currin September 20–November 19, 2016 980 Madison Avenue, New York.\nExtended through September 17, 2016 Plane.Site May 18–September 17, 2016 San Francisco.\nExtended through June 17, 2016 Alberto Giacometti | Yves Klein\n            \nIn Search of the Absolute April 27–June 17, 2016 Grosvenor Hill, London.\nThe Shape of Time\n            \nIn Collaboration with Gisèle Croës November 26, 2015–January 9, 2016 Hong Kong.\nIn the Studio: Paintings\n            \nCurated by John Elderfield February 17–April 18, 2015 West 21st Street, New York.\nIn the Studio: Photographs\n            \nCurated by Peter Galassi February 17–April 18, 2015 980 Madison Avenue, New York.\nSee all Exhibitions for Alberto Giacometti.\nFrom the Quarterly Game Changer\nBetty Parsons Wyatt Allgeier pays homage to the renowned gallerist and artist Betty Parsons (1900–1982).\n Peter Lindbergh on Alberto Giacometti Peter Lindbergh discusses photography and the history of his practice with Catherine Grenier, Director of Fondation Giacometti.

Unfortunately, owing to the covid-19 crisis, the exhibition had to be delayed for a year. As a result, the institution has invited Douglas Gordon to collaborate on several activities from April 2020 through April 2021. This unprecedented partnership, the institute’s first with a contemporary artist, will variously take the form of impromptu interventions, disseminations, exchanges, and meetings on the foundation’s website and in the spaces of the institute and its partners.

MARVELLOUS REALITY The great summer exhibition! The Fondation Giacometti is joining forces with the Grimaldi Forum to present for the first time in Monaco, an exceptional retrospective of the work of the sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti, the most important retrospective held in recent years and one organised by the curatorial office of Émilie Bouvard, the Fondation’s scientific and collections director. This voyage into the creative works of Alberto Giacometti takes place in an atmosphere of wonder, the wonder of Giacometti in the face of “marvellous” reality, as he often put it. He endeavoured to represent, without hierarchy, what he saw around him: loved ones, objects from his studio, everyday things, landscapes from his Swiss childhood or the suburbs of Paris. The scenography of the exhibition, the richness of the works presented,  amazes in turn the viewer who is placed at the heart of the artist’s intimacy. The exhibition route devotes a significant part to all periods, to all media, sculpture (plaster, bronze), painting, drawing and print that make up Giacometti’s work. It allows a complete view of his creative output, from early works to his surrealist period, from the return to figuration to his post-model work, and to the invention of the great icons of the post-war period. Bringing together nearly 230 works accompanied by photographs, the exhibition is punctuated with masterpieces and offers the visitor the opportunity to make wonderful discoveries based around 14 original sequences. The route revivifies in particular the atmosphere of the studio by revealing the detours and questions that mark the creative process of Alberto Giacometti. The themes favoured by the artist – the representation of the human head, of the face, of the female body – particularly stands out, but we also discover his relationship to loneliness, to melancholy and to his hard work with his models: his wife Annette, his brother Diego and his close friends. The visitor thus encounters another Giacometti, one who experiments with the limits of sculpture, and the formidable painter who, as well as portraits, also worked with the genres of landscapes and still life.

{"id": 90, "data": "Narrative Bio Alex Katz was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1927. In 1928, at the outset of the Depression, his family moved to St. Albans, a diverse suburb of Queens that had sprung up between the two world wars. Katz was raised by his Russian émigré parents, both of whom were interested in poetry and the arts, his mother having been an actress in Yiddish Theater. Katz attended Woodrow Wilson High School for its unique program that allowed him to devote his mornings to academics and his afternoons to the arts. In 1946, Katz entered The Cooper Union Art School in Manhattan. At Cooper Union, Katz studied painting under Morris Kantor and was trained in Modern art theories and techniques. Upon graduating in 1949, Katz was awarded a scholarship for summer study at the Skowhegan School for Painting and Sculpture in Maine, a grant that he would renew the following summer. During his years at Cooper Union, Katz had been exposed primarily to modern art and was taught to paint from drawings. Skowhegan encouraged him to paint from life, which would prove pivotal in his development as a painter and remains a staple of his practices today. Katz explains that Skowhegan’s plein air painting gave him “a reason to devote my life to painting.” Katz’s first one-person show was held at the Roko Gallery in 1954. Katz had begun to develop a circle of acquaintances within the second generation New York School painters and their allies in the other arts . He counted among his friends the figurative painters Jane Freilicher, Fairfield Porter, and Larry Rivers, photographer Rudolph Burckhardt, and poets John Ashbery, Edwin Denby, Kenneth Koch , Frank O’Hara, and James Schuyler. From 1955 to 1959, usually following a day of painting, Katz made small collages of figures in landscapes from hand-colored strips of delicately cut paper. In the late 1950s, he made a decision to attempt greater realism in his paintings. He became increasingly interested in portraiture and painted his friends and in particular his wife and muse, Ada. Katz began using monochrome backgrounds, which would become a defining characteristic of his style, anticipating Pop Art and separating him from gestural figure painters and the New Perceptual Realism. In 1959, Katz made his first painted cutout. At first these were cut out from canvas and mounted on contoured wood; soon, he began painting them directly onto the cut wood. In the 1960s, he shifted to painting directly on shaped aluminum sheets, a practice which has continued throughout his career, forming a series of freestanding or wall-mounted portraits that exist in actual space. In the early 1960s, influenced by films, television, and billboard advertising, Katz began painting large-scale paintings, often with dramatically cropped faces. In 1965, he also embarked on a prolific career in printmaking. Katz would go on to produce many editions in lithography, etching, silkscreen, woodcut and linoleum cut. After 1964, Katz increasingly portrayed groups of figures. He would continue painting these complex groups into the 1970s, portraying the social world of painters, poets, critics, and other colleagues that surrounded him. He began designing sets and costumes for choreographer Paul Taylor in the early 1960s, and he has painted many images of dancers throughout the years. In the 1980s, Katz took on a new subject in his work: fashion models in designer clothing. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Katz focused much of his attention on large landscape paintings, which he characterizes as “environmental.” Rather than observing a scene from afar, the viewer feels enveloped by nearby nature. Katz began each of these canvases with “an idea of the landscape, a conception,” trying to find the image in nature afterwards. In his landscape paintings, Katz loosened the edges of the forms, executing the works with greater painterliness than before in these allover canvases. In 1986, Katz began painting a series of night pictures—a departure from the sunlit landscapes he had previously painted, forcing him to explore a new type of light. Variations on the theme of light falling through branches appear in Katz’s work throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century. At the beginning of the new millennium, Katz also began painting flowers in profusion, covering canvases in blossoms similar to those he had first explored in the late 1960s, when he painted large close-ups of flowers in solitude or in small clusters. Beginning in 2010, Katz re-framed his subject matter, employing more drastic cropping of individual portraits. He also began composing multiple portraits using tightly cropped images of the same subject sequenced across the linen. Over the last few years, Katz has frequently begun his process by taking photographs with his iPhone, which he then prints out, cuts, and collages into compositions. From these maquettes, he may make painted studies or go straight to making a large-scale cartoon, from which he paints an oil on linen. During an extended stay in Pennslyvania from late winter through early summer of 2020, Katz made more than 50 paintings, mainly of flowers and landscapes he saw around him Alex Katz's work has been the subject of more than 250 solo exhibitions and nearly 500 group exhibitions internationally since 1951. These exhibitions include: the Whitney Museum of American Art (1986); Brooklyn Museum of Art (1988); Staatliche Kunsthalle, Baden-Baden (1995), Instituto Valenciano de Arte Moderno, Valencia (1996); P.S. 1/Institute for Contemporary Art, New York (1997-1998); the Saatchi Gallery, London (1998); Kunst und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Bonn (2002); The Jewish Museum, New York (2006); National Portrait Gallery, London ( 2010); the Albertina, Vienna (2010); Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2012); Tate St. Ives (2012), Guggenheim Bilbao (2015), Serpentine Gallery, London (2016), The Cleveland Museum of Art (2017), Lotte Museum of Art, Seoul (2018), Tate Liverpool (2018), Museum Brandhorst, Munich (2018), Musee de L'Orangerie, Paris (2019), Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris (2019) and the Fosun Foundation, Shanghai (2020).\n The Paul J. Schupf Wing for the Works of Alex Katz, which opened at the Colby College Museum of Art in1996, presents ongoing exhibitions of its in-depth collection of Katz’s paintings, cutouts, drawings, and prints. Katz has received numerous accolades throughout his career.  Among them, Katz was inducted by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1988.  In 1978, Katz received the U.S. Government grant to participate in an educational and cultural exchange with the USSR. Katz was awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for Painting in 1972. Works by Alex Katz can be found in over 100 public collections worldwide.

I want to paint the now [...] the immediate present. And that's what consciousness is.' Artist website Instagram.\nComing of age as an artist in 1950s New York, Alex Katz developed his unique approach to contemporary representational painting at the height of Abstract Expressionism. Over the seven decades since his first exhibition in 1954, he has produced a celebrated body of work, including paintings, drawings, sculpture and prints. A pre-eminent painter of modern life, he draws inspiration from films, billboard advertising, music, poetry and his close circle of friends and family. Primarily working from life, he produces images in which line and form are expressed through carefully composed strokes and planes of flat colour. His great admiration for Henri Matisse's sense of colour, composition and economy of means is evident in Katz's work, as is his interest in the American vernacular tradition. Katz's most recognisable works are large-scale canvases populated by simplified figures set against a monochrome background that minimises any sense of context. Ada, the artist's wife for over 60 years, is a frequent subject in his work, appearing in innumerable paintings since they married in 1958. He began collaborating with famed choreographer and dancer Paul Taylor in 1960, creating costumes and set designs for his dance company. Beyond this work for the stage, the collaboration sparked Katz's interest in the representation of motion, a theme he has continued to explore in his depictions of models and dancers.\n Read more Download CV.\nComing of age as an artist in 1950s New York, Alex Katz developed his unique approach to contemporary representational painting at the height of Abstract Expressionism.

He began collaborating with famed choreographer and dancer Paul Taylor in 1960, creating costumes and set designs for his dance company. Beyond this work for the stage, the collaboration sparked Katz's interest in the representation of motion, a theme he has continued to explore in his depictions of models and dancers. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Katz's canvases increased in size and he created a number of multi-panel paintings, often with dramatically cropped figures and faces. He was greatly influenced by television in this period, particularly the monumental scale of the cinema screen. Through the late 1980s and 1990s, he focused much of his attention on large-scale landscape paintings, which he characterises as 'environmental'. A born and bred New Yorker, Katz spends his summers in Lincolnville, Maine and has captured his summer home and its surroundings in all their rural splendour. Variations on the theme of light falling through branches appeared in Katz's work throughout the 1990s and 2000s. At the beginning of the new millennium, he also began painting a profusion of flowers, covering canvases in blossoms, a subject he had first explored in the late 1960s, when he painted close-ups of single flowers or small clusters. In the 2010s, he began using multiple tightly cropped images of the same subject sequenced across the canvas as if in a strip of film, combining a variety of angles to create the impression of an environmental portrait. Born in Brooklyn, Katz lives and works in New York. He studied at the Cooper Union School of Art in New York and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. He has created numerous public art projects throughout his career, including a Times Square billboard (1977), an aluminium mural for Harlem Station (1984), and a recent installation of 19 large-scale works on glass for the New York subway. His work has been the subject of over 200 solo exhibitions internationally, including at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1974, 1986, 2002); Institute of Contemporary Arts, London (1990); Baltimore Museum of Art (1996); Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin (2007); Sara Hildén Art Museum, Tampere, Finland (2009); National Portrait Gallery, London (2010); Albertina, Vienna (2014); The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2015); Serpentine Galleries, London (2016); Tate Liverpool (2018); Musée de l'Orangerie, Paris (2019); and Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid (2020), followed by a career retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York in 2022.

{"id": 94, "data": "Skip to content Credit: Sebastian Kim Alex Katz (American, b.1927) is one of the most recognized and widely-exhibited artists of his generation. Often associated with the Pop Art movement, Katz began exhibiting his work in 1954, and since that time he has produced a celebrated body of work that includes paintings, drawings, sculpture, and prints. His earliest work took inspiration from various aspects of mid-century American culture and society, including television, film, and advertising, and over the past five and a half decades he has established himself as a preeminent painter of modern life, whose distinctive portraits and lyrical landscapes bear a flattened surface and consistent economy of line. Utilizing characteristically wide brushstrokes, large swathes of color, and refined compositions, Katz created what art historian Robert Storr called \"a new and distinctive type of realism in American art which combines aspects of both abstraction and representation.\" Since the 1950s, Alex Katz's work has been the subject of more than 200 solo exhibitions and nearly 500 group exhibitions around the world. His work can be found in nearly 100 public collections worldwide, including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institute, Washington, DC; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; The Tate Gallery, London; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, among many others.

{"id": 98, "data": "Skip to main content Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n Alex Katz is on fire. He said so himself, when I visited his studio one day this spring. “One thing after another is coming up,” the ninety-year-old said, flashing a wide smile that transformed his usual expression of slight gloom. His proposal to place a series of cutout sculptures of his wife, Ada, on the median of New York’s Park Avenue had been accepted by the city, and he had been commissioned to enhance the interior of a subway station. “I told them a couple of little mosaics in the subway isn’t going to change anything, what you need is an environment—and they went for it,” he said. Nineteen five-foot-high paintings, transferred to glass by artisans and embedded in the walls, are now turning the F train’s Fifty-seventh Street station into a playground for Katz’s boldly colorful, high-intensity art. “I wanted the paintings done on porcelain,” Katz told me, “but the guy said, ‘Porcelain only lasts twenty-five years. This will last forever.’ ” Paintings for several upcoming exhibitions, including a major survey show at the Lotte Museum, in Seoul, were stacked against the walls of Katz’s studio on West Broadway. The most recent were from two new series, which he referred to as “Calvin Klein Girls” and “Coca-Cola Girls.” Katz had seen a video for Calvin Klein underwear while riding in a taxicab, and it had led to a dozen or so very large oil paintings of nubile young women (and a few of young men) in skimpy black underwear. The backgrounds are uniformly dark blue, but the paintings are bathed in light, which emanates from suavely painted areas of bare skin. The Coca-Cola girls are in white one-piece bathing suits, against red backgrounds. “That’s Coca-Cola red, from the company’s outdoor signs in the fifties,” Katz explained. “You know, the blond girl in the red convertible, laughing with unlimited happiness. It’s a romance image, and for me it has to do with Rembrandt’s ‘The Polish Rider.’ I could never understand that painting, but my mother and Frank O’Hara both flipped over it, so I realized I was missing something. They saw it as a romantic figure, riding from the Black Sea to the Baltic.” Katz is on easy terms with art history, all the way back to Thutmose’s exquisite portrait bust of Queen Nefertiti, circa 1340 B.C., which he’s visited in the Neues Museum, in Berlin. He cites Thutmose as one of his favorite artists, right up there with Goya, Manet, and Matisse. In the nineteen-fifties, when most of the serious art being done was abstract, Katz outraged scores of artists and formalist critics by inventing new ways to paint the human figure. He has always had his own direction, which has not been the direction of mainstream art in any of the last seven decades. In a Katz painting, style—the way it’s painted—is the primary element. His confident, crisply articulated technique makes us see the world the way he sees it, clear and up close, with all but the most essential details pared away. Even today, Katz’s style is too stripped down for some people, who think it looks easy. “My work is like pablum to them,” he tells me. “You know, pretty girls, flowers, you can’t be serious. I refuse to make sincere art. Sincere art is art that relies on subject matter to carry it. An honest painter is one who doesn’t paint very well. And it shows!” (Another wide grin.) Katz, as critics have increasingly come to realize, is a very good painter. “He’s like a master class in painterly virtues,” the artist David Salle, whose admiration for Katz’s work has led to a lasting friendship between them, told me recently. “A few years ago, I was at the Art Institute of Chicago, where they have a painting by Alex from the late sixties,” he said. “There are two boys in the foreground, with a view to the bay stretching out behind them. The composition is incredibly complex—with wonderfully fitted-together shapes, colors, tones, and value patterns, executed with effortless perfection. It’s an unsung masterpiece. As I was looking at the Katz, I turned my head to the left and saw in the adjacent room a wall of paintings by Gerhard Richter, and Richter’s just collapsed.” Paintings by Richter sell for tens of millions of dollars at auction. Katz’s highest auction price, achieved at a Sotheby’s sale in May, is nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. “Dan, you forgot to put on your out-of-office.” Facebook Twitter Email Shopping.\nKatz hasn’t had a major survey exhibition in New York since the Whitney Museum gave him a retrospective, in 1986. “I never fit in,” he told me. “I’m not a Pop artist, and people can’t see my work as realistic, either.” The Museum of Modern Art owns several of Katz’s best paintings, but it hasn’t given him a show. Katz’s dealers—he was with Fischbach for about ten years, Marlborough for thirty, and Pace for ten—have had no trouble selling his work, and in recent years more and more European museums have been showing and buying it, but the art world does not consider him a major contemporary artist, in the same league as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly, and others of his generation. Gavin Brown, whose gallery Katz joined in 2011, believes he can change that. A cutting-edge, risk-prone dealer who launched the careers of Peter Doig, Elizabeth Peyton, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and Chris Ofili, Brown is determined to get Katz into the pantheon. “Alex is in top mental and physical condition, and he’s applying seventy-five years of eye, hand, and brain experience to this craft,” Brown said to me this past spring. “He is also making astounding paintings—paintings that astound him. I think my job is to push him up in people’s eyes to the premier league.” On one of my visits to his studio, Katz let me watch him paint. When I arrived, at ten o’clock on a Sunday morning, he was waiting on the sidewalk to let me in and bring me up in the elevator. The building has five floors, and when Katz and Ada moved into it, in 1968, every floor was occupied illegally by an artist. (The law against living in industrial lofts was eased for artists in his neighborhood in 1971.) Ada came out from the kitchen, calm and smiling and still beautiful, and considerably smaller than she appears in the many paintings her husband has made of her. They live in the front half of the loft, a large, impersonal space with high ceilings, not much furniture, and a few treasures that he’s bought at auction—a small figure painting by Marsden Hartley, a woman’s head by Francis Picabia, a de Kooning drawing that’s “better than anything they have at the Modern.” Katz’s studio is in back, a single big room bisected at one point by a dividing wall. The blank canvas that he was planning to work on was ten feet high and fourteen feet wide. Katz, who is lean, wiry, agile, and flawlessly bald, had prepared the two colors he was going to use, black and ultramarine blue, in aluminum pie plates, with a third plate for the thinning medium. This was going to be a night painting, he explained, a landscape, something he had glimpsed through the rear window of his car when he was driving in the Pennsylvania countryside just before nightfall. “It doesn’t happen very often that you see something and know you have to paint it,” he said. He’d made a small sketch that evening, in oil on Masonite, and later, in the studio, he did a six-foot-by-eight-foot warmup painting, which was propped against a column to the left of the big canvas. Moving deliberately, Katz climbed five steps to the top of a creaky wheeled platform and started applying ultramarine to the upper-right section of the canvas, using a housepainter’s six-inch-wide brush. The paint went on easily, in smooth, unhurried strokes, back and forth and diagonally. One of his rules is “no noodling,” which means no fussy brushwork. He came down, moved the platform a few feet to the left, and climbed up again to do the next part. Every now and then he paused to consult the smaller sketch, which he had with him on the platform, or the warmup canvas. He kept going back over the painted areas, to adjust the tone. “I’m not sure the blue is right,” he said, at one point. “We’ll see when the black comes into play.” It took him about half an hour to finish the sky. Occasionally, between trips up and down the steps, he paused to wipe up drops of paint that had fallen beyond the brown paper he’d laid on the studio’s faded but immaculate linoleum floor. Katz’s New York studio, on West Broadway, where his recent work includes a series he calls “Coca-Cola Girls” (on the right), inspired by advertising signs from the fifties. Photograph by Gillian Laub for The New Yorker.\nWhen he switched to black, for the lower half of the painting, he didn’t need the platform. The black was lustrous, somewhere between glossy and matte. He worked upward from the bottom until the only strip of bare canvas was a narrow, uneven gap between the two colors. Still using a big brush, but painting more slowly, he began to fill in that space. Barely discernible shapes and outlines emerged in a few places: tree branches against the night sky. There was a sense of movement and distance. Katz was painting wet into wet, and not making mistakes. He stepped away from the canvas, about ten feet back. “Looks pretty good,” he said, after a minute or so. He got back up on the platform and worked for another twenty minutes, making deft finishing touches with a smaller brush. An hour and ten minutes after he’d started, he backed off, took another long look, and said, “It’s perfect.” I asked Katz whether it was true that his father used to dive off bridges for money. “Not for money—for the hell of it,” he said. “My father was a he-man. On our block in Queens, they got up a petition not to sell houses to Negroes. Twenty-three families signed it, but my father wouldn’t sign. ‘First they say that, and then they ban Jews,’ he said. Some high-school kids came and threw rocks at the house, so what does the he-man do? Call the cops? No. He opened the door and charged them. He tackled the biggest guy, the fullback. ‘I roughed him up a little,’ he told us, which meant he didn’t hurt him.” Katz’s parents, Isaac and Sima, had met in Russia before they emigrated, separately, to New York, Sima in 1918 and Isaac a few years later. She was an actress, a star in the Yiddish theatre on the Lower East Side—her stage name was Ella Marion. Isaac worked for Sima’s brother in the wholesale-coffee business. He dressed well, rode a motorcycle, and cared about style and high culture—“an apprentice aristocrat,” as Katz described him. When he found out that Sima was living in Brooklyn, Katz said, “he looked her up and knocked her up, and that was it.” An office in Alex Katz’s studio, filled with photos of his family. Photograph by Gillian Laub for The New Yorker.\nKatz was born in 1927. A year later, the family moved from Brooklyn to St. Albans, in Queens, a mixed neighborhood of English, Irish, German, and Italian households with one other Jewish family, across the street. Bernard, Katz’s younger brother, was born there in 1932. The boys grew up largely on their own. “I did whatever I wanted,” Alex remembers. “If it was wrong, they didn’t punish me—they just said don’t do it again.” His mother, who knew six languages, had him reciting Edgar Allan Poe when he was four. As a child, he read a lot—fiction, poetry, the Book of Knowledge—and he drew all the time. He covered the stairwell wall with crayon drawings; his parents were surprised, but not angry, and the drawings stayed. When he was in second grade, he won the top prize in a citywide drawing contest for public-school children. The principal of his grade school urged him to go to the High School of Music and Art, in Manhattan, but Isaac and Sima didn’t want him travelling that far on the subway. He went instead to the Woodrow Wilson Vocational High School, in Queens, because “you could do art half the day there.” For the next three years, he studied industrial design and learned classical drawing techniques by copying antique plaster casts. His ambition was to be a commercial artist. He played a lot of basketball, made the track team, and became a very good social dancer and a snazzy dresser, with seven zoot suits in his closet. The year Katz turned sixteen, a truck ran into his father’s car when it was stopped at a red light, and killed him. The two boys were almost completely on their own after that. “I think Alex was closer to our father than I was,” Bernie Katz remembers, but both of them had been somewhat intimidated by Isaac. Two weeks before the accident, Alex had seen an ad for life insurance in the back of a comic book, he recalled, and on an impulse he had sent in the initial payment (twenty-five cents) on a policy for his father. “We got a payout of ten thousand dollars,” he said. “It was all the money we had then. My mother said I was born under a lucky moon.” “Wait, people! Let’s not rush into a bad deal.” Facebook Twitter Email Shopping.\nKatz joined the Navy at eighteen, to avoid being drafted. It was 1945, and the war was nearly over. He shipped out on a converted luxury liner that went to Marseilles, then back to North America, through the Panama Canal, and across the Pacific to Honolulu and Tokyo. Released from service in 1946, he took the entrance exam to Cooper Union, the city’s full-tuition-scholarship school of art and architecture, and got in easily. “When he went to Cooper, he had to get up at 7 A.M. and take a bus and a subway, and right then I knew he was going to make it,” Bernie said. The teaching was doctrinaire modernism—Cubism, Bauhaus design, and the inexorable triumph of abstract art—none of which impressed Katz. He’d decided to be a fine artist, but he had no use for the fixed positions of modernist dogma, and he was never tempted by abstraction. The technical side of art, the craft of painting and drawing, was what appealed to him. He developed a personal style that he describes as “very fashionable at Cooper,” with borrowings from Paul Klee, Pierre Bonnard, and (especially) Henri Matisse. “But then I started painting outdoors, and I just ditched all that.”.\nWhat took him outdoors was a summer scholarship to the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, in Maine, which he attended in the summer of 1949, right after he graduated. Jean Cohen, his girlfriend at the time, an abstract painter and a fellow-student at Cooper Union, went too. The teaching at Skowhegan was more traditional than at Cooper Union. Students went out in trucks every morning to paint the Maine landscape. Katz had never done direct painting—looking at something and painting it on the spot, with no preliminary sketches. “It was like feeling lust for the first time,” he wrote in “Invented Symbols,” an informal autobiography that he published in 2012. He told me, “You’re working from inside your head, not thinking, just doing it.” He also discovered Maine light, which struck him as richer and darker than the light in Impressionist paintings. Katz and Cohen got married in 1950, and went back to Skowhegan that summer. “Jean was very pretty, and intellectually serious,” Katz said. “We were married for six years, but it was more like being roommates.” In 1954, after spending three summers in rented houses nearby, Katz, Cohen, and Cohen’s painter friend Lois Dodd bought a house together outside the town of Lincolnville, on the seacoast near Camden. It came with twenty acres of land, and cost twelve hundred dollars. Katz and Cohen were divorced two years later, and Katz became the sole owner in 1963. The house has been his summer home for sixty-four years. Ada Katz standing next to a portrait of herself (“Ada,” from 2018). Photograph by Gillian Laub for The New Yorker.\nFrom the time he graduated from Cooper Union, Katz had known that he wanted to be a figurative painter. He saw no reason there couldn’t be new forms of representational art that were as powerful and contemporary as Abstract Expressionism, and he was pretty sure he could find them. Katz was wildly competitive. “At Cooper, I went from someone who was basically incompetent to being the best painter in the school,” he told me. His idol was Matisse. “I couldn’t believe a human being could paint that well,” he said. Katz wanted to do what sounded deceptively simple: “To paint what’s in front of you.” By choosing to represent the world he knew, Katz said, and to do so in ways that he was inventing, “I completely alienated myself from traditional modern art and from traditional realistic painting, and also from the avant-garde.” It took him ten years to find his way. Living in cheap downtown lofts, supporting himself by working for a frame-maker three days a week, he experimented with small paintings—New York street scenes, Maine landscapes, still-lifes, and figure paintings adapted from amateur family photographs. He wanted to paint in an open style, like Jackson Pollock, with no fixed outlines or contained forms, “but I didn’t know how to do it,” he said. “I destroyed a thousand paintings, just tore them up and threw them in the fireplace.” In the mid-fifties, he switched to small cut-paper collages that were clearly influenced by Matisse’s late work. For a three-month period in 1957, his self-confidence faltered. “I kept making paintings, and they were good, but they were boring,” he said. “It was the only time in my life when a thing like that happened.” What pulled him out of it was deciding to paint what he called “specific” portraits, recognizable images of real people—a decision that coincided with meeting Ada Del Moro. That was in the fall of 1957, at the opening of Katz’s two-person show at the artist-run Tanager Gallery, on Tenth Street. “A whole bunch of us went out to have coffee afterward,” Katz said. “Ada had a tan, and a great smile, and she was with this guy who looked like Robert Taylor—fantastic-looking guy. But he didn’t put her coat on—I did.” Katz called the next day, and invited her to a Billie Holiday concert. Poised, beautiful, and highly intelligent, Ada was a research biologist at Sloan Kettering. One of his earliest paintings of her, done soon after they met and now owned by the Colby College Museum of Art, in Maine, is called “Ada in Black Sweater.” She stands facing us, arms folded, a dark-haired young woman with wide-set dark eyes and a full mouth, against a white background. Katz has included just enough detail to make her recognizable. She keeps her distance, self-contained and inscrutable. They were married in February, 1958. “Ours was like an arranged marriage, because our families were so similar,” Katz told me. “We’re Jewish off the boat, and they’re Italian off the boat. On Sunday afternoons, both families listened to opera on the radio. No one ever voted for a Republican. But Ada is only liberal in politics—aside from that she’s a snob. Ada never makes a social mistake, but I make them all the time.” “Ada in Black Sweater,” from 1957. Courtesy Colby College Museum of Art.\n“Ada gave him a complex human presence that I don’t think I had seen before in his work,” Katz’s friend Sanford Schwartz, the writer and critic, told me. Katz has painted her more than two hundred times, and she is the subject of countless drawings and prints. When a show called “Alex Katz Paints Ada” opened at the Jewish Museum, in 2006, Ada granted a brief and guarded interview to the Times’ T magazine. “I was sitting with my hands in my lap,” she said, “and this guy that I was interested in was looking at my eyes, my ears, my shoulders. The whole thing was just very sensual. And I didn’t think I could handle it. But then it became just this thing that he did. I was sitting and he was painting, and that was it.” I asked Katz what it was about Ada that made her such an irresistible subject. “She’s got perfect gestures,” he said. “And she’s a classic American beauty—full lips, a short nose, and wide eyes. She’s also a European beauty. When I started to paint Ada, I was influenced by Picasso’s Dora Maar. Dora Maar had better eyes than Ada, but Ada had a better neck and shoulders, and a much better body.”.\nAda gave up her scientific career and stopped working when Vincent, their only child, was born, in 1960. It is unkind but tempting to think that her real life since then has been on canvas, personifying every stage in Katz’s long career. With “Ada Ada” (1959) and “The Black Dress”(1960), he introduced paintings with more than one image of the same subject—two Adas in the first, and, in the second, six, each one subtly different, all wearing the same emblem of New York chic. (Like most of her clothes at the time, the dress was made by her mother.) “The Red Smile,” which sets Ada’s tightly cropped profile and shoulder-length dark hair against a background of cadmium red, marks Katz’s move into much larger paintings; the canvas is six and a half feet high by nine and a half feet wide. His main influences at this point were television ads, movie closeups, Japanese prints (by Utamaro, in particular), and billboards. He had decided that the way to “get the same velocity as de Kooning” was to go for flat, simplified images and really big scale. “There was no figurative painting with that kind of scale and muscle,” he told me. “The field was wide open, and I just stepped in.” “The Black Dress,” from 1960. Courtesy Alex Katz Studio.\nKatz had found a way to paint portraits that he described, in a 1961 statement, as “brand-new & terrific.” Ignoring character and mood, he offered the pure sensation of outward appearance—not who the people were, but how they appeared at a specific moment. “I can’t think of anything more exciting than the surface of things,” he later told an interviewer. He painted everyone this way, not just Ada, and in the mid-sixties he started painting groups of people in social situations. “The Cocktail Party” shows a gathering of eleven smartly dressed people (including Ada) in a New York loft. In “Lawn Party,” thirteen guests mingle convivially outside a shingled golden-brown country house. The clothes, the gestures, the hair styles, are all specific to the era, but the painting’s immersion in a perpetual now—what Katz called “quick things passing”—keeps it from looking dated. Although Katz was friendly with Fairfield Porter, Jane Freilicher, and other traditional realists of the period, his work was never realistic. The faces of his subjects are smooth and unblemished, almost generic, and the background details, when they exist, are minimal. His paint surfaces became thinner and smoother in the nineteen-sixties, with few visible brush marks (and no noodling). To resolve the compositional problems of people in groups, he moved away from direct painting. He taught himself the Renaissance technique of pinning a full-sized brown-paper “cartoon” to the canvas, and forcing (“pouncing”) dry pigment through pinholes to establish the outlines. He still does this with large paintings. Katz will use any available means, including obsolete techniques, to get brand-new and terrific effects. “Good boy!” Facebook Twitter Email Shopping.\nThere have always been people who disliked his work. The Times critic Hilton Kramer, despite his frequent praise, questioned its “emotional vacancy” and “air of untroubled sociability.” Robert Hughes, in Time, called Katz the Norman Rockwell of the intelligentsia, which was odd—the art-world intellectuals who wrote for October and the academic quarterlies consistently ignored him. Others found the paintings not just cool but cold, or took issue with their increasingly monumental size. Katz’s work had started to get attention in the late fifties. For a brief period he felt he was “on the bubble,” as he said, meaning ahead of just about everyone else. A 1959 solo show at the Tanager Gallery, which featured his portraits with flat backgrounds, had been a financial failure but a critical success. At the opening, de Kooning, whom Katz knew only slightly, came over to tell him that he liked the paintings. (“He said I shouldn’t let people knock me out of my position.”) Rauschenberg and Johns took him to dinner, and Rauschenberg posed for a Katz portrait—a double image of the artist, seated. Katz saw Rauschenberg and Johns socially a few times after that. Their work impressed him, but Katz thought he was a better artist. “He has this intense drive and competitiveness,” Vincent Katz, who grew up to be a poet and a writer, told me. “He sees what everybody else is doing, and his goal is to be on top.” “Upside Down Ada,” from 1965. Courtesy MOMA, gift of Agnes Gund.\nWhen Pop art made its sensational début, Katz’s paintings, with their bold areas of color and closeup aggressiveness, seemed at first to be related to it, but there was no real connection—popular culture has never been his subject. Katz was not included in the game-changing 1962 “New Realists” show at the Sidney Janis Gallery, or in Henry Geldzahler’s “New York Painting and Sculpture” show at the Met, in 1969. Leo Castelli, who showed Rauschenberg, Johns, Frank Stella, and several of the Pop artists, visited Katz’s studio, but didn’t take him on. When Katz saw Roy Lichtenstein’s new paintings at the Castelli Gallery, he said to himself, “ ‘Alex, you’re no longer on the bubble.’ It was absolutely clear to me.” Lichtenstein’s comic-strip images and blown-up commercial ads made Pop a household term. Right behind Pop came minimal art and conceptual art, and appropriation and performance and video and the myriad varieties of postmodernism, none of which had much, or anything, to do with the craft-based work that Katz was doing. “Minimalism was excluding things, but my work was compression,” he told me one day. As for conceptual art, it was “mostly philosophical ideas, and it comes from universities. A lot of artists don’t master their craft until they’re thirty-five, but you can be a first-class conceptual artist when you’re eighteen.”.\nBeing off the bubble was “a bit of a shock,” Katz admitted, but it didn’t slow him down. He had no doubts about his work, and there were always people who believed in him. In the fifties and later, he had been close to Frank O’Hara, James Schuyler, John Ashbery, and other New York poets. “They liked my paintings and I liked their poetry,” he said. O’Hara reviewed Katz’s work favorably in ARTnews and elsewhere, and bought two of his paintings in 1960. “I think Katz is one of the most interesting painters in America,” O’Hara wrote. “He has the stubbornness of the ‘great American tradition’ in the dominating face of European influences.” O’Hara was in Katz’s studio at four o’clock one morning, telling him what to do, Katz recalled. “I said, ‘Listen, Frank, I know how good I am,’ and he said, ‘Don’t get porky with me. You’re the one who’s going to have to hang near Matisse.’ ” Katz’s career might have taken a different path if O’Hara, who became an assistant curator at the Museum of Modern Art in 1960, hadn’t died in 1966—he was hit by a beach buggy one night on Fire Island. “Rose Bud,” from 1967. Courtesy Alex Katz Studio / Photograph by Paul Takeuchi.\nKatz’s real mentor in those days was Edwin Denby, the poet and dance critic. “Edwin was like my graduate school,” Katz said. “Through Edwin, I got involved with modern dance.” Denby and the filmmaker Rudy Burckhardt are immortalized in one of the cutout-metal sculptural portraits that Katz started doing in the late fifties; they sit on folding chairs in his West Broadway loft, facing one another, deep in a discussion, so convincing that for a moment I thought they were real. Denby introduced Katz to the choreographer Paul Taylor, and for three decades Katz designed sets and costumes for Taylor’s dance company. They had a falling-out at one point, over a Katz set design that Taylor disliked, but they eventually reconciled, and collaborated on one more dance. Fallings-out are not uncommon with Katz. He says exactly what he thinks, on every occasion, and his opinions can be abrasive. The immense night landscape was still on the long wall in Katz’s studio a week after he painted it. “This one turned out to be a real winner,” he told me. “Several people have been in to see it.” One of them was Richard Armstrong, the director of the Guggenheim Museum. “I could feel the wind coming through it,” Armstrong told me. “That’s a hard thing to do.” The ultramarine night sky and the black foliage looked more clearly defined this time. “It’s drying,” Katz explained. “The thing I’m most proud of is my finish—the finish on the painting. After three months, the shine goes away, but the surface keeps changing. Oil paint moves, unlike acrylic. In five years, it’s much richer, and you can see into the black. It took me years to get to this finish.” In the days before he started the painting, he explained, his longtime studio assistant, the painter Juan Gomez, had prepared the canvas by applying five undercoats—three coats of gesso and two coats of lead white. “And under that are two coats of rabbit-skin glue on the canvas,” he said. “The light goes into it, and comes back out.” “Vincent and Tony,” from 1969.

There was one in his last show at Gavin Brown’s, a seven-foot-by-fourteen-foot landscape called “Field 1,” with hints of brown foliage in an expanse of pale-yellow paint. (“The one with nothing in it,” Katz said.) At this late stage in his career, after a lifetime of figurative painting, he is engaged in a strange dance with abstraction. For the past three years, he’s been painting shadows on grass—six large versions were on view earlier this year, in a solo show at the Richard Gray Gallery, in Chicago. The shadows are green and the grass is mostly yellow, and for some reason that seems just right. “The grass paintings are really hard,” he told me. “People liked them, but I didn’t get what I wanted.” He planned to try again this summer, in Maine. Katz’s mid-career retrospective at the Whitney Museum, in 1986, a selection of works from three decades, was widely and favorably reviewed. “The paintings look easy, the way Fred Astaire made dancing look easy and Cole Porter made words and music sound easy, but don’t let’s be fooled,” John Russell wrote in the Times. “When it comes to art that conceals art, Katz is right in there with those two great exemplars.” Seeing so much of his work together revealed something else, though: an unexpected range of emotion and complexity. Ada, without relinquishing her sphinxlike self-possession, could be many different people—a film star in “Blue Umbrella 2,” a seductress in “Upside Down Ada,” a chic suburban wife and mother in “Ada and Vincent in the Car,” a Valkyrie in “The Red Smile.” Friends and strangers, children, Katz himself, in a few searching self-portraits, are players in a social panorama that runs deeper than the flat surfaces and primary colors would suggest. “He has made in painting what John Updike and John Cheever did in literature—a choral portrait of a certain America,” the New Museum’s artistic director, Massimiliano Gioni, said recently. A vein of humor hovers beneath the surface, and sometimes breaks through. In “Moose Horn State Park,” a fully antlered bull moose turns to look at us over its right shoulder—“Just like Betty Grable,” Katz suggests. “Blue Umbrella 2,” from 1972. Courtesy Alex Katz Studio / Peter Blum Gallery, New York.\nIn spite of the good reviews, though, the Whitney show did little to boost his reputation or his sales, and the art world’s tepid reaction made Katz more competitive than ever. “I wanted to move to a place in art that was unstable and terrifying,” he said. After many years of concentrating on the human figure, he began painting what he described as “environmental landscapes”—landscapes so large that they enveloped the viewer. (“You could be inside them,” as he put it.) He also began a series of night paintings—cityscapes, black buildings with a few lighted windows, and seascapes and forests, precursors of the one I had watched him paint, all caught at the moment before last light fades to black. Many of Katz’s best paintings capture the light and the atmosphere of a specific time of day—none more hauntingly than his 1982 image of an adolescent girl, alone, in “Tracy on the Raft at 7:30.” His night paintings probed the outer limits of visible light. Into the nineties and beyond, Katz found fresh subjects to explore: light falling through trees, or on fields of flowers; dancers and performers whose personal style or way of moving caught his eye. The European market for his work expanded dramatically in the late eighties. Younger artists, riding a new wave of figure painting by German and American neo-expressionists (Sigmar Polke, A. R. Penck, Julian Schnabel, David Salle), discovered Katz’s work and recognized him as an ally. As the painter Jacqueline Humphries wrote to me recently, “I see in Alex’s work so much of what I love in Manet: immediacy, grandeur, plus the keen, urbane and candid assessment of subject.” Shara Hughes, an artist who is in her mid-thirties, said, “He does it right. At first, I thought he was boring, until I realized how hard it is to be that simple. Now I look at it all the time.” I asked Katz if it felt like he was back on the bubble. “Yeah,” he said. “I think I bounced twice. Matisse did that with his late cutouts, but Picasso didn’t. Listen, one bubble is miraculous.” “Times Square Mural,” from 1977. Courtesy Alex Katz Studio.\nA possible excuse for not taking Katz’s work seriously is that he has such a good time making it. Recognizing no taboos, he is free to experiment with whatever catches his interest. He has even had a fling with high-end fashion. Eternity only exists in the present moment, Katz decided, and fashion offered a direct line to the now. In the early nineteen-eighties, he did a number of paintings of fashion models wearing clothes by Norma Kamali, and this led, in 1984, to a twenty-two-foot-long painting called “Eleuthera,” of four female couples in Kamali bathing suits. “I wanted to make a composition of people touching—how different girls touch each other,” he explained. “They’re sisters, jocks, lesbians, what have you, and they all touch differently.” Fashion and art used to be considered incompatible, because fashion was decorative and art, supposedly, was not. Katz has no quarrel with decoration; it’s an aspect of art, he says, and only suspect when it becomes the main aspect. When I asked him if he considered himself a good decorator, he said, “I’m fair. I think my paintings are a little too aggressive to be good decoration.” What about Warhol’s?, I inquired. “Warhol is an illustrator, basically,” he replied. “None of his paintings hold up as paintings. In terms of image-making the guy is fantastic, and as a decorator he’s up there with Twombly.” It’s sometimes difficult to follow Katz’s line of thought, which moves unpredictably. Jackson Pollock, he said, “is the epitome of good decorative painting.” Francis Bacon “is perfect for a house, but Franz Kline is not housebroken—too much energy.” I brought up David Hockney, the British-born figurative innovator whose career, like Katz’s, has been consistently outside the mainstream. “Hockney’s an illustrator, but he learned to paint in the end,” Katz said. “My hat is off to him.” “Tracy on the Raft at 7:30,” from 1982.

It hasn’t changed at all—aside from a new electric stove in the kitchen and modern plumbing—since Katz, Jean Cohen, and Lois Dodd pooled their resources to buy it, in 1954. The rooms are small and cramped, the ceilings are low. My wife and I drove up from New York in June. There was no place to park—the front yard and a small space across the street were occupied by Katz’s three automobiles: a 1975 Cadillac Eldorado that his brother Bernie had sold him, secondhand, in the early nineteen-eighties, a dingy Oldsmobile, and a BMW that was temporarily out of commission. The Katzes had arrived a day earlier, by charter plane and taxi. Ada, who was moving with difficulty because of a bruised hip, came along as Katz took us on a short walk through the woods to his studio. We passed the cottage where their son, Vincent, and his Brazilian-born wife, Vivien, stay when they’re there. (Vincent and Vivien have two children, twin boys just entering college.) The studio was built twenty years ago to replace Katz’s original one, in a beautiful old barn adjoining the house; the barn wasn’t big enough for his increasingly large paintings, and on hot days it was stifling. Designed to Katz’s specifications by a Japanese architect, the new studio is a big, airy room, fifty feet long by thirty feet wide, with a high ceiling and unpainted wood beams. Through one window you can see a freshwater lake where Katz swims every day. “It’s too small for motorboats, which is great,” he said. Ada, who has a way of being there and not there, went off to sit by herself on a bench outside. She had made it clear from the beginning that she did not want to be interviewed. (“I’m not part of this,” she said.) “I think sometimes she’s really bored,” Katz admitted. “I’m a little difficult, because I do what I want to do. I spend most of the summer painting, and she’s not particularly social, so a lot of the time she’s by herself. She reads a lot. When Vincent’s here everything’s O.K., but Vincent isn’t here that much, and I’m not going to stop painting to entertain her.” Has she ever complained about that?, I asked him. “No,” he said. He likes to tell about the time when, at one of his openings, a person asked, “Is that the artist?” and someone else said, “It must be, he’s standing with Ada.” “SoHo Morning,” from 1987. Courtesy Alex Katz Studio / Photograph by Paul Takeuchi.\nTwo dozen stretched canvases in various sizes were lined up against the wall of the pristine studio, ready for use. The only painting in the room was propped on a table against the back wall—a nine-inch-by-twelve-inch image, dark-green forms on a yellow background, that held the eye from across the room. “I had a real piece of luck this morning,” Katz said, as we moved toward it. “I was going swimming, but on the way I saw something, and decided to go inside and paint it instead. It’s the thing I’ve been after for three years. ‘Bingo,’ I said. ‘It looks like shadows on grass to me.’ I don’t even know yet if it’ll be horizontal or vertical, but I got the tonal thing, the tonal range.” He was going to do three more small versions on Masonite right away, he said, before starting a big canvas. Katz, who turned ninety-one in July, keeps in shape with a daily regimen of swimming and rigorous exercises. “I used to do two hundred sit-ups, three hundred pushups, and a hundred chins,” he said. (His chinning bar was in the doorway to a small studio kitchen.) “I can’t do as many now.” He paints seven days a week. “I never remember a time when he wasn’t working,” Vincent told me. We walked out to the road so that Katz could show us a house he’d bought recently. He’d heard that the owner had sold it, but the contract wasn’t signed, so Katz offered fifty per cent more than the purchase price, sight unseen, and the owner agreed. It was one of a number of neighboring properties that Katz has bought, partly to preserve his and Ada’s privacy, but also because he thinks he might eventually turn his land into a place for young artists to come and work. Local real estate is still relatively cheap. “The farming has always been terrible,” Katz said. “We live in a rural slum.” Dinner that night was at the Whale’s Tooth, in Lincolnville. The restaurant overlooks a meagre strip of beach, which is a good deal less meagre in several Katz paintings. Ada was more animated than she’d been earlier. When Katz was going on about his aggressive style in art, she said, “I’m going to be very aggressive and say it’s time to eat.” They’d had their sixtieth wedding anniversary on February 1st. “We almost missed it,” Katz said. “CK 4,” from 2017. Courtesy Alex Katz Studio / Photograph by Paul Takeuchi.\nThe next day, the four of us drove to the Colby College Museum of Art, in Waterville, which has a wing devoted to Katz. The museum owns more than nine hundred of his works, including prints and drawings, a great many of them donated by the artist. “There I am again,” Ada said, resignedly, as we passed a metal cutout portrait of her on the lawn. Sharon Corwin, the director, took us first on a tour of the museum’s modern-and-contemporary collection. Many of its key works were donated by the Alex Katz Foundation, which buys works by lesser-known artists and gives them to museums that promise to keep them on view. Alex does the buying—there is no board of directors—and decides where the works will go. “Nothing to MoMA, or places that would just stick them in the closet,” he explained. “I like to buy from artists who’re having a hard time in their twenties, because I remember what that meant to my confidence as an artist.” Since he lives frugally and doesn’t play the horses, this appears to be one of his few extravagances. The Katz exhibition, in the Paul J. Schupf Wing, changes periodically. The standout painting for me was “Canoe, ” a 1974 image of a faux-birch-bark canoe and its watery reflection. The painting is twelve feet long, about as big as a real canoe. The scale, the color, the light, the buttery surface, the virtuoso paint handling that doesn’t call attention to itself—everything about it is top-level Katz. Another landmark is the thirty-foot-long “Pas de Deux,” in which five male-female couples, most of whom are Katz’s friends, touch one another with varying degrees of intimacy. This painting was donated by Paul J. Schupf. A private investor who became an avid collector of Katz’s work in 1970 or so, Schupf put up half the funding for the wing that bears his name, and he has donated several other important paintings to it, but he and Katz no longer speak to each other. (Personal animosities—heightened by what Schupf considers Katz’s insufficient gratitude and overinflated sense of entitlement—ended the friendship.) There were terrific paintings from the nineteen-fifties to the present in the wing’s three large spaces. The exhibition struck me as a compelling argument for the great, revelatory New York retrospective that Katz wants and deserves—and should have while he’s still around, but probably won’t. Katz wastes no time in being bitter. “He knows who he is,” Gavin Brown had told me. “As he said the other day, ‘I’m alive, and in my studio every day, and people buy my paintings. I just want to keep throwing the dice against the wall.’ ” Before leaving the gallery, my wife asked Katz to identify a dark-haired woman in a group of cutout paintings called “Wedding.” “That’s Ada,” he said. “But it doesn’t look like Ada!” Katz, with a big grin: “Nothing does.” ♦.\nCalvin Tomkins is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

One of the most recognized and widely-exhibited artists of his generation, Alex Katz was born in 1927 in Brooklyn, New York. Studying at the Cooper Union School in New York from 1946 to 1949 Katz left for the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Maine. It was here that he was exposed to painting from life, which would prove pivotal in his development as a painter and remains a staple of his practices today. Katz has admitted to destroying a thousand paintings during his first ten years as a painter in order to find his style. Since the 1950's, he worked to create art more freely in the sense that he tried to paint \"faster than [he] can think.\" Every year from early June to mid-September since 1954, Katz has moved from his SoHo loft to a 19th-century clapboard farmhouse in Lincolnville, Maine. Coming into his own style of expression, his paintings are defined by their flatness of color and form, their economy of line, and their cool but seductive emotional detachment; with a key source of inspiration being the woodcuts produced by Japanese artist Kitagawa Utamaro. From 1954 to 1960, Katz made a number of small collages of still lifes, Maine landscapes, and small figures. It was during this time that Katz began exhibiting his work, and since then has produced a celebrated body of work that includes paintings, drawings, sculpture, and prints. Taking inspiration from various aspects of mid-century American culture and society, including television, film, and advertising, over his storied career he has established himself as a preeminent painter of modern life. Utilizing characteristically wide brushstrokes, large swathes of color, and refined compositions, he is most often associated with the Pop Art movement even though his creations predate it.\n © Masterworks Fine Art Gallery.

{"id": 102, "data": "Alex Katz An iconic figure of the 20th century New York scene, Alex Katz is an American artist who was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1927. After graduating from the Cooper Union Art School in Manhattan in 1949, he was awarded a scholarship by the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. He lives and works between New York city and Lincolnville (Maine).  Often associated with the Pop Art movement, Katz began exhibiting his work in 1954, and since that time he has produced a celebrated body of work that includes paintings, drawings, sculpture, and prints. His earliest work took inspiration from various aspects of mid-century American culture and society, including television, film, and advertising, and over the past five and a half decades he has established himself as a preeminent painter of modern life, whose distinctive portraits and lyrical landscapes bear a flattened surface and consistent economy of line. Katz's flattening of forms, simplification of detail, and alla-prima paint application, are trademarks of his work.  Since the 1950s, Alex Katz's work has been the subject of more than 200 solo exhibitions and nearly 500 group exhibitions around the world. His work can be found in nearly 100 public collections worldwide, including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institute, Washington, DC; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; The Tate Gallery, London; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, among many others. A retrospective of his work will be held at the Guggenheim Museum in 2022.\n Alex Katz in his studio, 1964.

{"id": 103, "data": "Katz (today, in SoHo) pursued figurative painting even in the 1950s, when Abstract Expressionism was at its height. Stephanie Sinclair.\nThe cavernous lobby of New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art is jammed with people, but it is impossible to miss Alex Katz. The artist famous for his bright figurative paintings is standing by the information desk wearing a parka so blindingly orange it looks radioactive. Orange is one of Katz's favorite colors, and the jacket, adorned with reflective silver strips, is the kind that a guy on a road crew might wear to direct traffic in a rainstorm. But this French-made parka is downright chic, rather like its owner, who looks at least a decade younger than his 82 years, with a smooth head (he shaves it daily) and features as sharp as those of the suave figures who populate his paintings. He has come to the Met to see an exhibition of works by Pierre Bonnard, the French Post-Impressionist who was a big influence when Katz was starting out. \"Bonnard was very important in the early 1950s,\" Katz says. \"His painting was in the same direction as [Jackson] Pollock—away from a contained plane. It was all over light, just light and color.\" He goes on: \"They're great paintings; they have great atmosphere. Bonnard's great with reds and oranges—it is very hard to get transparency with red!\" A maverick from the beginning, Katz came of age when Abstract Expressionism still reigned, yet he turned to painting landscapes and the human figure. Over time, his paintings got bigger. \"Appropriating the monumental scale, stark composition and dramatic light of the Abstract Expressionists, he would beat the heroic generation at their own game,\" the critic Carter Ratcliff wrote in a 2005 monograph on Katz. \"It was an open door,\" Katz says today. \"No one was doing representational painting on a large scale.\" Taking cues from Cinemascope movies and billboards, his highly stylized pictures also anticipated Pop Art. His deadpan evocation of flat, bright figures had an everyday quality that linked them to commercial art and popular culture. Early on, his work was often panned. Clement Greenberg, the critic famous for championing the Abstract Expressionists, \"actually went out of his way to say how lousy I was,\" Katz recalled in an article he wrote for the New Criterion. But critical opinion has never seemed to matter to Katz. \"Alex is a man of supreme confidence and clarity,\" says Adam Weinberg, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. \"He quickly realized what he was about and was absolutely undaunted and single-minded in that pursuit. That persistence enabled him to weather the contradictory movements in the art world.\" Today, Katz's popularity is exploding. His quin­tessentially American evocations of people at cocktail parties or the beach and his landscapes of Maine took off in Europe, especially after the collector Charles Saatchi showed off his Katzes in his private museum in London a decade ago. The painter has also found a substantial new audience at home in the United States. As figurative painting made a comeback in the late '80s and '90s, a younger generation of artists began to see Katz with new appreciation. \"Artists were looking at their predecessors, but there were not a lot of them who'd continued in that figurative zone consistently, with his level of detachment,\" says Weinberg. \"Coolness is something that artists of all generations admire—cool in the sense of detachment, but [also] cool in the sense of hip.\" Like Warhol before him, Katz has no problem bridging the worlds of art and fashion, whether creating artwork for W magazine or getting supermodels such as Christy Turlington and Kate Moss to sit for him. \"I've always been interested in fashion because it's ephemeral,\" he says. Katz himself even modeled for the J. Crew spring catalog this year. The stylish octogenarian is, by his own account, as busy as ever. So far this year, Katz has had exhibitions in Milan and Catanzaro in Italy, Paris, Vero Beach in Florida, Finland and at his New York City gallery, PaceWildenstein, where he recently showed a series of monumental sunsets. \"I want to compete with the kids!\" he said one afternoon while sitting on a leather sofa in his sparsely furnished SoHo loft, in Manhattan, where he has lived since 1968. Just beyond the living room is his studio, an airy, white-walled space that floods with daylight. There isn't a speckle of paint on the linoleum floor. \"I don't like mess,\" says Katz. \"I don't like paint on my clothes or my hands or my furniture.\" A series of gigantic, freshly painted canvases are propped up around the studio—each a frieze of enormous heads, some of men, others women. The pieces are reminiscent of what the artist was doing decades ago, most memorably in a series of Times Square murals he made in 1977. \"I've been working to make this kind of ‘artificial realistic' painting,\" he says of the latest efforts. \"I want to do something larger than a descriptive painting.\" To make one of his large works, Katz paints a small oil sketch of a subject on a masonite board; the sitting might take an hour and a half. He then makes a small, detailed drawing in pencil or charcoal, with the subject returning, perhaps, for the artist to make corrections. Katz next blows up the drawing into a \"cartoon,\" sometimes using an overhead projector, and transfers it to an enormous canvas via \"pouncing\"—a technique used by Renaissance artists, involving powdered pigment pushed through tiny perforations pricked into the cartoon to recreate the composition on the surface to be painted. Katz pre-mixes all his colors and gets his brushes ready. Then he dives in and paints the canvas—12 feet wide by 7 feet high or even larger—in an epic session of six or seven hours. \"It's all done wet on wet,\" he explains. The paints blend and become luminous. From far away or in reproduction, Katz's pictures look hyper-smooth, but up close you notice the brushstrokes and the small bits of accent color that attract the eye. More than painterly technique or the image depicted, though, his work is about the style. \"I'd just as soon have the style be the content, style rather than form,\" he says. \"The style is what puts all the disparate parts together.\" Katz's wife, Ada, walks into his studio, offering coffee. A visitor might be forgiven for presuming to have met her before, so familiar is she as Katz's muse and model over the course of their 51-year marriage. The long hair that brushes her shoulders is gray now, but the expressive dark eyes in her serene face are the same as those that look out from under a hat in Red Coat (1982), from under an umbrella in The Blue Umbrella (1972) and from all six Adas wearing the same glamorous cocktail sheath in one of his most popular works, The Black Dress (1960). Her husband says she's an American version of Picasso's famous model and mistress Dora Maar. But, Katz is quick to add, \"When I saw photos of Dora Maar, I said, ‘Picasso cheated on her neck and shoulders!' Ada has a much better neck and shoulders.\" Katz's speech still bears traces of his childhood in Queens, New York. The son of an émigré who'd lost a factory he owned in Russia to the Soviet revolution, Katz \"drifted into fine art,\" he says. He was studying commercial art at a local vocational high school when he began to draw from casts of antique sculpture and won admission to the Cooper Union School of Art in Manhattan. He met Ada, who had studied biology at New York University, at a gallery opening in 1957. \"She's a great beauty,\" he says. \"The gestures are perfect. She's like an actress in a sense. She's also a very sharp Italian girl from the Bronx—you can't beat that.\" (The couple have one son, Vincent Katz, 49, a poet and art critic.) Social life with Ada in the '50s and '60s revolved around poets—Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch—as much as painters. \"They were dealing with everyday experiences, in a kind of sophisticated way,\" Katz recalls. (In Katz's 1967 portrait, Koch looks slightly uneasy behind a big pair of horn-rimmed glasses.) Katz may be best known for his portraits, but he has also devoted himself to landscapes—works that are daring precisely because they lack people and \"throw away the lifelines\" of human interest, noted the critic David Cohen. \"They work on Katz's own painterly terms or not at all.\" Many are evocations of Maine, where he has gone to paint every summer for the past 60 years, and where he has a house and studio on a small lake. \"It's a conceit in a way,\" Katz says. \"It's like you can paint the same river twice differently. I often paint in the same place. It's like painting Ada over and over again—to see if you can get something else out of the same subject matter.\" The Colby College Museum of Art, in Waterville, Maine, has devoted a 10,000-square-foot wing to Katz's artworks, the majority of which he donated. In addition, he has purchased numerous pieces for the museum by artists such as Jennifer Bartlett, Chuck Close, Francesco Clemente, Elizabeth Murray and, most recently, Marsden Hartley (a Maine native). Five years ago, he curated a show at Colby of such young art stars as Elizabeth Peyton, Peter Doig and Merlin James, who work in the same figurative territory staked out by Katz. Katz's agelessness is hard won. He's a super-jock, who runs and does \"tons of\" push-ups and sit-ups when he's home in New York; in Maine, he works out, he says, up to four hours a day—running, bicycling and swimming. How far can he run? \"As far as I like. I can outperform a lot of 21-year-olds physically,\" he says. He says he also competes with artists half his age \"for the audience,\" though with limited weaponry. \"My subject matter is not particularly interesting,\" he says with a smile. \"It's not hot subject matter—you know, no crucifixions, no violence, no sex.\" His tools are color and light, and his own stripped-down vision of the world. \"I try to make painting that looks simple,\" he says, and cites seeing a Velázquez portrait of a Hapsburg infanta in a traveling exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum when he was in his mid-20s: \"It was nothing—so simple! Something could be so simple and so much. Just a green background, a little girl—everything was perfect. There's no story line. It's immediate. He painted directly. He saw it, he painted it.\" A Katz painting, for all its coolness, projects feeling. \"The pictures are supposed to be lyric, they're supposed to give you an up,\" he says. \"I want to make something that's sort of like your happier condition. Impressionist pictures are basically that—Impressionist painting is a happy lie.\" Katz's happy lies are those timeless beautiful faces with perfect skin, or the trees of a Maine summer, forever leafy and green. Yet, sometimes, even the elegant Ada can look grave, on the brink of tears. And the landscapes can be dark—most notably, his haunting \"nocturnes\" or night scenes, with their nuanced layers of darkness far moodier than so many of the crisp and colorful portraits. In the recent series of sunsets, for example, Katz, in essence, is capturing the passing of time. It was hard to make the oil sketches, he reports—only 15 minutes or so on a Maine porch before dusk fell. In these large paintings, seen together, time passes quickly, and the sky becomes an impossible orange, reflected in the lake. Then, in the next painting, the lake has turned dead, to gray. These pictures, with black trees in the foreground, are elegiac—their subject is the last few minutes of daylight that no one can hang onto. Luckily, there is consolation, even what Katz calls a kind of eternity, in art itself. \"That's the difference between a painting and a sunset,\" he says. \"The painting will stay with you, but the sunset disappears.\" And so Katz keeps his focus on the moment, painting like there's no tomorrow.

Sunrise Alex Katz has painted landscapes throughout his career that often feature views from his home in Maine, as does Sunrise, this recent collaboration with Graphicstudio. Katz captures what he refers to as the present tense, or a flash, just before the image comes into focus. The moment is the early morning sun glowing beyond a forest of birch trees, a sublime scene as the sun rises from the horizon and scatters light in colors across the sky. The subjects of Katzs landscapes are form, surface, space and light as they appear to him in nature. Sunrise is a 6-run lithograph, woodcut, screen print with the initial run a 3-color blend roll for the sky, followed by 3 additional lithographic runs of yellow, orange and a dense black. A hand-cut red oak woodcut with a transparent black ink is followed by a final screenprint run also in a very transparent flat black. This technique allows for the rich wood grain to be seen in the depths of the birch trees that are central to the image. TRACY, SHARON, KYM, MAE Portraits are one of the great subjects of Alex Katz's paintings and prints. Katz's editions with Graphicstudio are illustrative of his signature approach and style of transforming his circle of family and friends into visually arresting icons. In Tracy, the artist shows the back of the model's head only, suggesting character and personality through the set of the shoulders and the contrasting gray and gold tonalities of the hair, skin, dress and background. Mae is deceptively simple with subtle tonalities and luminous layers. COLEMAN POND II & III Landscapes are also great subjects of Alex Katz's boldly simplified paintings and prints. Coleman Pond II and Coleman Pond III are characteristic of his minimalist treatment of the landscape: on a dark blue field or shifting downward from light to dark, a few spare lines define sky from earth and sketch out details of vegetation. The heliorelief (photographic woodcut) was created and printed in the mokuhanga style traditionally used for the famed Japanese ukiyo-e prints of the 17th through 19th centuries. The woodblock is shin-a or basswood veneer, and the ink is nikawa, hand-milled from pigment, fish-glue and water; the Japanese kozo paper is hand-printed with a hon baren. KATE, WHITE HAT AND SUNGLASSES At Graphicstudio Alex Katz explored the cyanotype technique, a printmaking process first invented in 1841 and commonly used for architectural blueprint drawings. Kate and White Hat and Sunglasses are outlined in vivid blue, the portrait is a bleed, where the print image is extended to the edges of the paper. Kate is a portrait of the American born actress Kate Valk, known for her title role Brutus Jones in the Wooster Group's acclaimed production \"The Emperor Jones\" by Eugene O'Neill. Alex Katz designed the show's poster featuring Kate Valk, which served as inspiration for the cyanotype print created at Graphicstudio. In White Hat and Sunglasses, the cartoonish preliminary sketch of Ada is revealed in the Prussian blue of the cyanotype process. Maine Landscape After one of the artist's first prints made in 1951, Maine Landscape, embodies the original version in heliorelief, a woodcut process developed at Graphicstudio in which an image on a translucent material is used to expose a light-sensitized woodblock, which is then cut with sandblasting. Characteristic of Katz's signature style, Maine Landscape is deceptively simple; its small size and forthright elements are immediately poignant and elegant.

We will present the more intimate side of the great painter's work: his small paintings or \"oil sketches\", preparatory studies in oil on board, often painted directly in front of the model or \"en plain air\", they contain the first idea for the large canvases. Here his brush strokes are spontaneous, loose and free, before becoming more stylized in the large paintings. American artist Alex Katz is one of the leading figurative painters of our time. Since the 1960s he has developed a highly innovative realist style unlike any of his contemporaries. His landscapes and figures excel in their simplicity of line, form and colour. His brushwork is light and confident, the compositions subtle and simple, the dimensions majestic. Katz creates powerful images. With his huge canvases, selective palette and two-dimensional surfaces he creates paintings that have both realistic and abstract elements and refuse to allow themselves to be pigeonholed. Having appeared on the American artistic scene at the end of the '50s, the years of Abstract Expressionism, and being a contemporary of Pop Art and the subsequent artistic movements, Katz surprisingly managed to reconcile the abstract movement with realism in US post war art, in a style that he himself defines as \"totally American\". The images are essential, luminous, direct and sharp, showing very intense colour planes, rendered in a particular bidimensional perspective, free of any sentimental connotation and yet able to communicate a profound emotional involvement. Alex Katz was born in New York in 1927 as the son of Russian - Jewish immigrants and studied painting at the Cooper Union School of Art from 1946 to 1949. After his first solo show at the Roko Gallery in New York in 1954, he began to work on drawings and collages, turning to portraits in 1957 and to large size paintings in 1962, after moving to his new studio in Soho. His first retrospective exhibition was held at the Utah Museum of Fine Art. After that he showed regularly in American museums and galleries. In 1986 the Whitney Museum of American Art showed a large-scale retrospective and in 1997 the MoMA PS1 Museum in New York organized the exhibition \"Alex Katz Under the Stars: American Landscapes 1951-1995\". The work of Alex Katz is widely represented at museum in the USA, including MoMA, the Metropolitan and the Whitney in New York, as well as in European Museums, like Tate Modern in London, the MMK in Frankfurt, the Albertina in Vienna and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. ALEX KATZ16 Febbraio - 30 Marzo 2013 La galleria Monica De Cardenas di Zuoz è felice di annunciare una mostra di nuovi dipinti di Alex Katz, in vista delle grandi retrospettive che l'artista avrà nei musei svizzeri Museum Haus Konstruktiv a Zurigo (6.3. -12.5.2013) e Musée Cantonal des Beaux Arts di Losanna (22.3.-9.6.2013) nel mese di marzo.A Zuoz - oltre a due ritratti di grandi dimensioni - mostreremo l'aspetto più intimo e spontaneo del grande maestro: i suoi studi preparatori realizzati in olio su tavola. Dipinti direttamente davanti al paesaggio o alla modella, spesso \"en plein air\", sono opere in cui Katz sperimenta l'idea, la composizione, l'atmosfera ed il colore, prima di trasferirli sulle tele di grandi dimensioni. La sua pennellata è ben visibile, libera e veloce ma precisa. Nato a New York nel 1927 da immigrati ebrei russi, l'artista americano Alex Katz è uno dei più importanti ed influenti pittori del nostro tempo. Dal 1946 al 1949 ha studiato pittura alla Cooper Union School of Art. Dal 1960 ha sviluppato uno stile figurativo inconfondibile ed altamente innovativo. Pur essendo apparso sulla scena artistica americana alla fine degli anni '50, durante gli anni di dominio dell'Espressionismo Astratto, Katz ha scelto la figurazione, ma ha saputo integrare nel suo stile elementi dell'Espressionismo Astratto: le vaste superfici di colore monocromo di Barnett Newman e la gestualità veloce e spontanea di Pollock e De Kooning. Al contempo Katz, ispirandosi ai mass media, al cinema ed alla fotografia, ha anticipato ed ispirato il movimento della Pop Art.Alex Katz è sorprendentemente riuscito a conciliare l'astrattismo ed il realismo nell'arte americana del dopoguerra, in uno stile unico e personalissimo. Sono immagini essenziali, luminose, dirette e nitide, dagli intensissimi piani di colore, rese in una particolare prospettiva bidimensionale e private di ogni connotazione sentimentale, ma che riescono a comunicare una profonda risonanza emozionale. Katz ama il ritratto, che non è mai ironico o giudicante ma, lontano dall'essere neutrale, attesta la sua devozione e attenzione nei confronti del suo mondo fatto di amici, artisti, poeti, musicisti e ballerini. Ritrae spesso il figlio Vincent e la moglie Ada, sua musa principale e da lui elevata ad icona del nostro tempo.Le sue opere si trovano nelle collezioni dei maggiori musei americani, tra i quali il MoMA, il Metropolitan ed il Whitney di New York e in alcuni musei Europei, tra i quali la Tate Gallery di Londra, il Centre Pompidou di Parigi, il Museo di Francoforte, l'Albertina di Vienna ed il Guggenheim di Bilbao.  ALEX KATZ16 Februar -30 März 2013 Als Auftakt zu den kommenden grossen Auftritten des amerikanischen Malers Alex Katz im Museum Haus Konstruktiv in Zürich (6.3.-12.5.2013) und im Musée Cantonal des Beaux Arts in Lausanne (21.3.-9.6.2013), zeigen wir in der Galerie in Zuoz - nebst zwei grossen Portraits - die intimere Seite des Malers: eine Auswahl seiner kleinen Bilder, Studien in Öl auf Masonit, von ihm \"oil sketches\" genannt. Diese werden oft direkt vor dem Modell oder sogar \"en plein air\" gemalt: sie beinhalten die erste Idee - in ihnen wird die Stimmung, die Komposition und die Farbigkeit getestet, bevor Katz das grosse Format angeht. Der Pinselduktus des Meisters ist darin frei und spontan zu sehen.Wir zeigen eine Auswahl der Motive, die er in den letzten drei Jahren gemalt hat: Portraits, Aktbilder, Landschaften und dazwischen neulich immer wieder Blumenbilder, die sich fast wie musikalische Partituren lesen: beinahe abstrakte Kompositionen, die sich auf die Essenz von Rhythmus und Farbe konzentrieren. Alex Katz wurde 1927 in New York als Sohn russisch-jüdischer Einwanderer geboren und zählt weltweit zu den wichtigsten Malern. Von 1946-49 studierte Katz an der Cooper Union Art School. Katz hat sich sehr früh für die gegenständliche Malerei entschieden und eine sehr eigenständige malerische Sprache entwickelt. Die sinnliche Wahrnehmung, das Malen der äusseren Welt, das war es, was er in die moderne Kunst einbringen wollte, während der Abstrakte Expressionismus seine grössten Erfolge feierte. Was ihn an einem Künstler wie Jackson Pollock interessierte, waren die Freiheit, Spontaneität und Schnelligkeit der Malerei, aber auch das Format seiner Bilder. Dieses Format faszinierte ihn auch an der Plakatwerbung und im Film. Die extreme Vergrösserung, die für diese Medien typisch ist, führt zur Verdeutlichung von Motiven, und darum ging es ihm auch bei seinen Bildern. Für ihn ist es wichtig, sagte er einmal in einem Interview, dass Kunst einfach und schlicht sei. Ein Gemälde sollte für möglichst viele Menschen offen sein und verschiedene Anknüpfungspunke bieten. Dies sei am besten mit einer einfachen Form zu erreichen. Direktheit und Schlichtheit kennzeichnen die Sprache von Alex Katz. Der Weg zur einfachen Form ist der Weg zur Abstraktion, auf dem die Aussage immer weiter verdichtet wird. Aus der individuellen Erscheinung eines Modells destilliert Katz den wesenhaften, allgemeingültigen Ausdruck. Die charakteristischen Merkmale seiner Sujets bewahrt er jedoch. Das gilt für seine Personendarstellungen ebenso wie für seine Landschaften. Seine Bilder besitzen die Qualität des Zeitlosen und sind doch historisch bestimmbar. Katz schildert die Gesten menschlicher Beziehungen, er fixiert flüchtige Augenblicke und ist gleichzeitig mit seinen zeitentrückten Szenen ein Verwandter der eleganten Künstler des Alten Ägypten und der fließenden Welt der klassischen japanischen Holzschnittkunst. Die Wiederentdeckung seines Werkes in den vergangenen fünfzehn Jahren gerade auch durch junge Künstler wie Elizabeth Peyton, Peter Doig oder Chantal Joffe belegt die anhaltende Aktualität seiner Kunst. Alex Katz ist in zahlreichen internationalen Privat- und Museumssammlungen vertreten und blickt auf eine reiche internationale Ausstellungstätigkeit zurück. Alex Katz - Press Release.\nTexts A.

{"id": 111, "data": "ALEX KATZ  “SOUP TO NUTS” THE SAO PAULO BIENAL PROJECT  SELECTED BY ROBERT STORR.\nInitiated at the invitation of its chief curator Jacopo Crivelli, Alex Katz: Soup to Nuts started out as a project for the 34th Sao Paulo scheduled to open in September 2020. Katz was to have been a featured artist presented in the main exhibition in the Oscar Niemeyer Pavilions of the Parque Ibirapuera, with an ancillary retrospective – for Katz his first in South America – hosted by Paulo Miyada at the Instituto Tomie Ohtake. The original checklist numbered around 100 works in all the formats and media Katz has utilized since the beginning of his career in the early 1950s. Although it can't possibly cover the same ground in any detail, this synoptic – \"haiku\" – version of that more expansive and comprehensive survey spans the same seventy year trajectory and touches on his key subjects – family, friends, fellow artists, poets, dancers, landscapes, cityscapes – collectively portraying the evolution of the \"good life\" in a cosmopolitan United States during the years of that country's greatest prosperity. As keen an observer of fashion in the streets and lofts of Manhattan as of the flora and fauna of his second home in rural Maine, Katz is a quintessentially Baudelarian artist, a spontaneous Manet-like realist when it comes to both the social and the natural world, a complete North American \"Painter of Modern Life.\" As such this show of [30 paintings] may fairly be regarded as a Katz feast \"from soup to nuts.\" – Robert Storr (Brooklyn, New York, September 2020) Alex Katz ,.\nBrown Night ,.\n1999.\nAlex Katz ,.\nFog 2 ,.\n1998.\nAlex Katz ,.\nRoad ,.\n1999.\nAlex Katz ,.\nVarick 1 ,.\n2008.\nAlex Katz ,.\nWashington Square 3 ,.\n2014.\n\"A lot of people want to paint something timeless, but I paint the immediate present.\" – Alex Katz.\nAlex Katz ,.\nAda ,.\n2018.\nAlex Katz ,.\nAda with Pink Sweater 2 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nAlex ,.\n2013.\nAlex Katz ,.\nVivien ,.\n2012.\nAlex Katz ,.\nSwimmer ,.\n1974.\n\"Everything is moving.

I am always tying up \nand then deciding to depart. In storms and \nat sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide \naround my fathomless arms, I am unable \nto understand the forms of my vanity \nor I am hard alee with my Polish rudder \nin my hand and the sun sinking. To \nyou I offer my hull and the tattered cordage \nof my will. The terrible channels where \nthe wind drives me against the brown lips \nof the reeds are not all behind me. Yet \nI trust the sanity of my vessel; and \nif it sinks, it may well be in answer \nto the reasoning of the eternal voices,\nthe waves which have kept me from reaching you. – Frank O’Hara  (Photo: Alex Katz studio in Maine, 1997).\nEnquire about Works Enquire%20about%20Works%20%28Alex%20Katz%29.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 2 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 5 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 10 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 11 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 12 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 14 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 15 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 16 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 18 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 21 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 22 ,.\n2019.\nKatz ,.\nDancers 26 ,.\n2019.\nAlex Katz ,.\nDancers 27 ,.\n2019.\n(Larger version of this image opens in a popup).

Illustrated by Alex Katz.\n Milk  Milk used to come in tall glass, heavy and uncrystalline as frozen melted snow. lt rase direct and thick as horse-chestnut tree trunks that do not spread out upon the ground even a little: a shaft of white drink narrowing at the cream and rounded off in a thick-lipped grin. Empty and unrinsed, a diluted milk ghost entrapped and dulled light and vision. Then things got a little worse: squared, high-shouldered and rounded off in the wrang places, a milk replica of a handmade Danish wooden milk bat. But that was only the beginning. Things got worse than that. Milk came in waxed paper that swelled and spilled and oozed flat pieces of milk. lt had a little lid that didn't close properly or resisted when pulled sothat when it did give way milk jumped out. Things are getting better now. Milk is bigger-half-a-gallon, at least-in thin milky plastic with a handle, a jug founded on an oblong. Pick it up and the milk moves, rising enthusiastically in the neck as it shifts its center of weight. Heavy as a breast, but lighter, shaping itself without much changing shape: like bringing harne the milk in a bandana, a neckerchief or a scarf, strong as canvas water wings whose strength was only feit dragged under water. On the highway this morning at the go-round, about where you leave New Hampshire, there had been an accident. Milk was sloshed on the gray-blueblack so much like a sheet of early winter ice you drove over it slowly, no matter what the temperature of the weather that eddied in through the shatterproof glass gills. There were milk-skins all around, the way dessert plates look after everyone has left the table in the Concord grape season. Only bigger, unpigmented though pretty opaque, not squashed but no less empty. Trembling, milk is coming into its own. – James Schuyler  (Photos): James Schuyler, Carl Morse, Alex Katz, and Bill Berkson, New Year’s Eve, 1962; Alex Katz in his studio, 1978).\nAlex KATZ ABOUT THE ARTIST ‘Well the idea is to paint what is in front of you. Narrative art is always behind the immediate present. The immediate present is what you see.’ Alex Katz, (b.1927, Brooklyn, New York) lives and works in New York City. Katz studied at the Cooper Union School of Art, New York and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Maine. In a career spanning 70 years Katz is renowned for his figurative and landscape paintings, although his practice has encompassed a wide range of disciplines. A prolific print maker, Katz has produced more than 600 editions in various mediums. Katz has frequently collaborated with poets and dancers, most notably a 50 year collaboration with Paul Taylor Dance Company which includes designing sets and costumes for some of Taylor’s most iconic works, as well as painting portraits of dancers which he continues to this day. Katz has engaged in numerous public art projects from his 1977 billboards in Times Square, to Harlem Station 1984, for a train station in Chicago, to his most recent installation of 19 large scale works on glass for the New York Subway to name a few. Katz’s work has been the subject of more than 200 solo exhibitions internationally: at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the National Portrait Gallery, London, among others. Works by Katz can be found in over 100 public collections worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Tate Gallery in London. A room at Vienna’s Albertina Museum is devoted to his work. In 2022 the Guggenheim Museum in New York will present a career spanning retrospective of his work.\n (Larger version of this image opens in a popup). (Larger version of this image opens in a popup).

Katz studied at the Cooper Union School of Art from 1946 to 1949. He then attended the renowned Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, which would later also produce such important artists as David Reed and Jason Rhoades, among others. From the 1950s onward, Katz developed a very independent painterly language which addresses the traditional genre of the landscape, as well as the portrait or figure painting. Although the general public sees Alex Katz as a pop artist, he does not consider himself to be one. Rather than emanating from a graphic implementation, such as that which pervades the works of Robert Indiana or Roy Lichtenstein for example, his images always emanate from painting. Katz always begins his work by occupying himself with paint, from which he develops his very characteristic large-scale intercourse with space. The design of his pictorial reality is usually laid out extensively and appears with sharp, clear edges in his works from, at the latest, the end of the 1960s onward. He sees himself as a post-abstract painter who, in his realistic painting style, arranges the figure elements and sign elements in such a way that the observers combine them “in their heads” themselves. Katz is interested in the elementary question: What is reality? Taking this question as a starting point, he has spent the past 50 years repeatedly exploring possible ways with which “realism” can be redefined. Color and light play a central role in his works. Thus, even despite the ostensible realism, he pays less attention to the motif than to the look and style, i.e. the appearance.

{"id": 118, "data": " Who is he? Alexander Calder, known to many as ‘Sandy’, was an American sculptor from Pennsylvania. He was the son of well-known sculptor Alexander Stirling Calder, and his grandfather and mother were also successful artists. Alexander Calder is known for inventing wire sculptures and the mobile, a type of kinetic art which relied on careful weighting to achieve balance and suspension in the air. Initially Calder used motors to make his works move, but soon abandoned this method and began using air currents alone. Need to explain Alexander Calder to a kid? Head over to the Tate Kids blog, for a simple and fun introduction..\n Was he always an artist? Calder always enjoyed making art. However, he trained as a mechanical engineer at the Stevens Institute of Technology in his early twenties. He began to pursue painting in earnest a few years after receiving this degree. He is said to have chosen mechanical engineering arbitrarily, simply because someone he befriended was going to study that subject. Nevertheless he excelled at mathematics, and the experience was later applied to his unique and ingenious artistic approach.\n Alexander Calder\nMobile (c.1932)\n.\n                           \nLent from a private collection 1992 © 2022 Calder Foundation, New York / DACS, London.\nWhat is he most famous for? Although not the first person to use metal and movement in his work, Calder became known for his pioneering use of both. In particular he was famous for what Marcel Duchamp christened, ‘mobiles’, and what Jean Arp named ‘stabiles’. Here, Calder explains the difference between the two terms:.\nThe mobile has actual movement in itself, while the stabile is back at the old painting idea of implied movement. You have to walk around a stabile or through it- a mobile dances in front of you. (The Artist’s Voice, Katherine Kuh) Essentially his mobiles moved, often lacking the traditional base or pedestal which would usually anchor a sculpture to the floor. Stabiles were simply sculptures which were stationary and placed on the ground. These were often made on a colossal scale. How did this come about? Calder visited Piet Mondrian’s studio in 1930, as described by him here:.\nIt was a very exciting room. Light came in from the left and from the right, and on the solid wall between the windows there were experimental stunts with colored rectangles of cardboard tacked on ….I suggested to Mondrian that perhaps it would be fun to make these rectangles oscillate. And he, with a very serious countenance, said: ‘No, it is not necessary, my painting is already very fast.’…This one visit gave me a shock that started things. (‘Calder’, Thames and Hudson, Ugo Mulas, H.H. Arnason) His response was to do what Mondrian refused to; make abstract art move.  What was his favourite subject? Calder loved the circus. In his twenties, whilst working at the National Police Gazette, he was asked to produce a series of illustrations of a circus troupe. As he later described in an interview;.\nI love the space of the circus. I made some drawings of nothing but the tent. The whole thing of—the vast space—I’ve always loved it. When he moved to Paris in 1926, his interest quickly escalated into the creation of his own miniature Cirque Calder, fashioned from an array of found materials. He would pack this into two suitcases and give performances to his friends. Soon the two suitcases became five, and Calder began to make some modest earnings from the venture. As such, his career as an artist began in a very unusual way. Was it all just fun and games? His grandson, Alexander S. C. Rower, would disagree:.\nIn historical photographs, Calder often seems to be amusing himself in his workshop, Yet as those who had the rare fortune to be present in the act of creation can attest, Calder’s “playing” was actually the antithesis of frivolity. Calder’s instinctual experimentation resulted in an extended legacy, now loudly resounding in contemporary art of the twenty-first century. (‘Calder’, Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Calder Foundation, Alexander S. C. Rower and Tae Hyunsun) What was his favourite drawing material? I think best in wire Calder always carried wire and pliers with him so that he could “sketch” in his favourite material. This has come to be known as ‘drawing in space’ because he would literally use the wire to create a drawing in the air. What was his favourite colour? It was probably red.\n I want things to be differentiated [within my work]. Black and white are first—then red is next… It’s really just for differentiation, but I love red so much that I almost want to paint everything red. I often wish I’d been a fauve in 1905 (The Artist’s Voice, Katherine Kuh) Alexander Calder\nUntitled (1937)\n.\n                           \nTate © 2022 Calder Foundation, New York / DACS, London.\nWhat were his thoughts on sculpture? Calder avoided analysing his work, believing that: “theories may be all very well for the artist himself, but they shouldn’t be broadcast to other people.” As a result this poem-like text which he wrote for the Abstraction-Création group magazine has often been taken as the closest thing to an explanation of his work:.\nHow can art be realized?Out of volumes, motion, spaces bounded by the great space, the universe.Out of different masses, light, heavy, middling- indicated by variations of size or colour- directional line - vectors which represent speeds, velocities, accelerations, forces, etc…-these directions making between them meaningful angles, and senses, together defining one big conclusion or many.Spaces, volumes, suggested by the smallest means in contrast to their mass, or even including them, juxtaposed, pierced by vectors, crossed by speeds.Nothing at all of this is fixedEach element able to move, to stir, to oscillate, to come and go in its relationship with the other elements in its universe.It must not be just a fleeting “moment” but a physical bond between the varying events in life.Not extractions But abstractions Abstractions that are like nothing in life except in their manner of reacting. (From Abstraction-Création, Art Non Figuratif, no. 1, 1932) Which are his key works? Aside from Cirque Calder, which is universally loved, the following artworks are perhaps his most iconic.\n In 1937 the Calder’s became very involved with the Paris World’s Fair, in particular the Spanish Pavilion. Calder offered to exhibit a mobile but initially the architect was against including a non-Spaniard in the show. However when they received a very plain looking fountain, which was to display liquid mercury from Almaden, they decided to call Calder in to create a new one. Calder’s Mercury Fountain was made of irregularly shaped steel plates for the liquid to run over, and also a rod with a red disc attached on one end, and the word ALMADEN written in wire hanging from the other. As the mercury moved through the fountain it would disturb the rod causing the disc and wire to oscillate in the air. The piece was shown alongside Picasso’s Guernica and entertained the audience greatly: It became a favorite pastime of onlookers to throw coins at the surface of the mercury and see them float. (Calder: An Autobiography with Pictures) Ignorant of the fact Calder was actually American, André Beucler praised Spain’s accomplishment: Spain has realized a masterpiece… The exploitation of the mercury of Almaden is an important industry for Spain. There would have been many ways to make this theme tedious… But, true artists, the Spaniards concentrated on one thing only: on the beauty of the mercury in its mysterious fluidity. (‘Calder’, Thames and Hudson, Ugo Mulas, H.H. Arnason) The piece can still be seen at Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona,but it is now displayed behind glass due to its high toxicity. In 1969, Calder’s monumental public artwork, his stabile Le Grande vitesse was installed in the plaza outside City Hall in Grand Rapids Michigan, USA. The title is a tongue-in-cheek French translation of the name ‘Grand Rapids’ which also means ‘Great Speed’. The artwork has caused great controversy from the word go. When locals discovered the plans there was a hot debate in the local newspapers about whether the project should go forward. Even to this day many people do not appreciate Calder’s vision. Nevertheless the Plaza has become known as Calder Plaza, and there is an annual arts festival on the artist’s birthday. Le Grande vitesse is even seen on street signs and the city government letterhead, placing the artwork at the heart of the city’s identity.\n How did he transport some of his artworks? Calder developed the idea of dismantling even large sculptures so they could be posted unobtrusively avoiding customs problems. He essentially designed flat pack artworks. He would also send detailed numbered and colour coded instructions along with the piece so that it could be reassembled correctly on the other end.\n What do the critics say? Jean-Paul Sartre on Calder’s mobiles: “The forces at work are too numerous and complicated for any human mind, even that of their creator, to be able to foresee all their combinations. For each of them Calder establishes a general fated course of movement, then abandons them to it: time, sun, heat and wind will determine each particular dance.”“One cannot describe his works- one must see them” said separately by Bruno E.

Calder preferred not to analyze his work, saying, \"Theories may be all very well for the artist himself, but they shouldn't be broadcast to other people.\".\nWikidata Q151580.\nView or edit the full Wikipedia entry.\nInformation from Wikipedia, made available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.\nGetty record.\nIntroduction Calder graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1919 with a degree in mechanical engineering. After taking classes at the Arts Students League, he became a freelance artist and illustrator, and published a book titled Animal Sketching. In the 1920s, Calder began traveling to Paris, where he was exposed to modernist tendencies in art. In 1930, after visiting Piet Mondrian's studio, where he was impressed by the studio environment, he began to create Comment on works: abstract, moving constructions, coined “mobiles” by Marcel Duchamp in 1931, for which he is most known. From the 1930s onward, Calder divided his time between trips abroad and his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, and as his commissions grew more frequent, his mobiles became increasingly gigantic. Examples are Flamingo, the stabile at Federal Center Plaza in Chicago, and L’Araignée rouge, at the Rond Point de La Défense Métro station in Paris..

Many artists made contour line drawings on paper, but Calder was the first to use wire to create three-dimensional line \"drawings\" of people, animals, and objects. These \"linear sculptures\" introduced line into sculpture as an element unto itself. Calder shifted from figurative linear sculptures in wire to abstract forms in motion by creating the first mobiles. Composed of pivoting lengths of wire counterbalanced with thin metal fins, the appearance of the entire piece was randomly arranged and rearranged in space by chance simply by the air moving the individual parts.\n Alexander Calder, known as Sandy, was born into a long line of sculptors, being part of the fourth generation to take up the art form. Constructing objects from a very young age, his first known art tool was a pair of pliers. At eight, Calder was creating jewelry for his sister's dolls from beads and copper wire. Over the next few years, as his family moved to Pasadena, Philadelphia, New York, and San Francisco, he crafted small animal figures and game boards from scavenged wood and brass. Calder's interest initially led not to art, but to mechanical engineering and applied kinetics, which he studied at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey (1915-1919).

Calder's Circus exemplified the playful wit that infused much of Calder's subsequent work. Three films were made of Calder's Circus performances, but the work's significance is that it is one of the earliest modern works in which the artist is equally involved as both a \"maker\" and a performer. Mixed media: wire, wood, metal, cloth, yarn, paper, cardboard, leather, string, rubber tubing, corks, buttons, rhinestones, pipe cleaners, bottle caps - Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York.\nArtwork Images c. 1927 Josephine Baker (III) Calder's illustrations for the National Police Gazette were often made of single, continuous lines. He learned this technique in mechanical drawing classes at the Art Students League. In 1925, Calder was the first to extend this line drawing approach into three dimensions. He soon began creating figurative and portrait sculptures using only wire to \"draw in space.\" His several sculptures of dancer Josephine Baker were his earliest works in this direction. These artworks were important in furthering both his career-long use of wire and his interest in open-space sculpture. Steel wire - The Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York.\nArtwork Images 1934 A Universe In the early 1930s Calder's desire to create abstract paintings that moved through space led to motorized works such as A Universe, in which the two spherical shapes traveled at different rates during a 40-minute cycle. Interested in astronomy, he compared his works' discrete moving parts to the solar system. These works were an important step towards his non-motorized mobiles, as well as forerunners to his Constellation series of the 1940s. Painted iron pipe, steel wire, motor, and wood with string - The Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York.\nArtwork Images 1941 Arc of Petals From the 1930s on, Calder created non-mechanized hanging, standing, and wall-mounted mobiles, whose movement was driven by random air currents. Early versions often used scavenged bits of glass or pottery, while later ones were generally comprised entirely of flat metal shapes painted solid red, yellow, blue, black, or white, such as this work. Calder succeeded in integrating natural movement into sculpture by assembling elements that balance themselves naturally by weight, surface area, and length of wire \"arm.\" The basic equilibrium he struck guarantees compositional harmony among the parts, no matter their relative positions at any given moment. Though many other artists have since created works based on his principles, even now, decades later, Calder is still the undisputed master of this form of sculpture. Painted and unpainted sheet aluminum, iron wire, and copper rivets - Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, Italy.\nArtwork Images 1937 Devil Fish Counterpoint to his mobiles, Calder created many stabiles, composed of intersecting shaped planes of bolted sheet metal, often painted a single color. Devil Fish was the first larger-scale stabile Calder made. By forming combinations of curved biomorphic shapes, Calder creates a swirling sense of motion, even in a static sculpture such as this. Later stabiles combined both organic and geometric forms. Sheet metal, bolts and paint - Calder Foundation, New York, New York.\nArtwork Images 1967 Man During his later years Calder produced many monumental stabiles and mobiles as public works for sites worldwide. Man was commissioned for Montreal's Expo '67. At 65 feet tall, its one of Calder's largest sculptures. Works such as Man contributed to the proliferation of public art during the second half of the 20th century. Such grand stabiles are dynamic works, with their arches, points, and flowing forms reaching out in multiple directions.

Article Wikipedia article References.\nAlexander Calder redefined sculpture by introducing into it the element of movement. He created sculptures and design objects that participated in the larger tendencies of European and American avant-garde, uniquely combining abstract art, modernist principles, machine and cosmic imagery in his works. His major contribution to the modernist redefinition of artistic media is the invention of two new categories of sculpture, called mobiles and stabiles.\nThe mobiles are constructions made of suspended objects that hang down from the ceiling and continuously move with the flow of air. These evolving sculptures served to Calder’s exploration of sculpture and its site of display, which led him to introduce space and movement as fundamental elements in the encounter of the audience with the work of art. In their movable nature, Calder's mobiles can be seen as an example of Kinetic art. The stabiles are large-scale fixed versions of the mobiles, which the artist created in his late years. These monumental abstract sculptures were installed in urban spaces around the world and contributed to revamping the conversation around public sculpture in the last decades of the 20th century.\nCalder was born in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia in 1898 to artistic parents. His father was a successful sculptor, and his mother worked as a portrait painter all her life. Calder's early fascination with sculpture began at the age of nine in his father's studio, where he started experimenting with mechanical devices and materials such as wire, sheet metal and wood. He created there his first constructions based on animal-designs. The fascination with construction and industrial materials would later bring Calder to graduate in mechanical engineering. The studies in physics and applied kinetics will crucially effect the artist’s early experiments with mechanized constructions. After trying many disparate jobs, Calder decided to follow his artistic leanings, and in 1923 enrolled at the Art Students League to study drawing and painting.\nAt that time, the Art Students League's faculty was composed by The Eight - a group of realist artists whose determination to bring art into closer touch with everyday life greatly influenced the course of American art. Calder's first large canvases and drawings of that period were directly inspired by his instructors' broad realist style and their ideas of freedom of artistic expression.\nIn 1926, Calder made the first of many trips to Paris with the desire to gain first-hand exposure of European Modernism. He became fascinated with the European incorporation of non-academic artistic media in sculptural practices as well as with the new stylistic directions in American art, which were building on the influence of European Cubism, Futurism, and Constructivism. Elements of Constructivism and its notion of achieving painterly effects through sculptural materials are particularly evident in Calder's works from 1926 to 1930. These include sculptures made of a single metal wire, such as Josephine Baker (1927), Rearing Stallion (1928), and Portrait of a Man (1929). These experiments with wire culminated in the creation of Calder's Circus (1926-1931), a miniaturized rendering of a circus featuring a complex arrangement of figurines of performers, animals and props. Made of wire, wood, metal, cloth, leather, these sculptures were specifically designed to be manipulated by Calder.  The artist gave performances of his kinetic circus in New York and Paris throughout the 1930s, receiving critical acclaim for his elaborate creation of a moving sculptural ensemble.\nBy 1928, Calder had started to gain popularity and was given his first solo show in New York at Weyhe Gallery. Throughout the 1930s, he continued to exhibit in New York, Paris and Berlin, and developed friendships with European and American avant-garde artists, such as Joan Mirò, Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Lèger, and Piet Mondrian; as Calder recalls in his autobiography, a visit to Mondrian's studio was a \"shock\" that led him to embrace complete abstraction. The move towards abstraction translated into the creation of a series of kinetic sculptures, dubbed mobiles by Duchamp, including Crank-driven Mobile (1931-32), Dancing Torpedo Shape (1932), and A Universe (1934). Calder incorporated mechanisms and motors in these abstract constructions to make the separate elements move at different speeds, using the materials' density and weight as guiding principles in planning the sculpture's movement in space. He later gave up motorized constructions and dedicated himself to designing self-moving sculptures hanging down from a ceiling which could be activated by air currents. He also created stationary abstract works that Jean Arp dubbed stabiles. The first of Calder’s outdoor works were made during this era as well.\nThe 1930s see Calder moving back to the United States and working on the construction of sets for ballets by Martha Graham and Erik Satie. In 1931, he was also invited to join the group Abstraction-Création, which included artists Jean Arp, Piet Mondrian, and Jean Hélion. Disks, spheres, wedges, and triangles in a rigorous palette of primary colors, black, and white, became the fundamental elements of Calder's mobiles from 1935 and 1936. Starting from 1936, the artist started to work on larger scale sculptures with the desire to generate even more dramatic casual spatial relationships. Lobster Trap and Fish Tail (1937), a mobile commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the museum's stairwell, points towards this new monumental direction, as well as to Calder's interest in organic forms.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Calder became internationally known - a unique position for an American sculptor at the time, - and was honoured with many prizes, commissions, and exhibitions. In 1945, Marcel Duchamp arranged a crucial exhibition of small-scale works made by Calder with scrap metal pieces at Galerie Louis Carré in Paris; Jean Paul Sartre wrote a seminal essay on the artist’s mobiles for the accompanying catalogue.\nIn his late years, Calder dedicated himself to large-scale projects, stabiles, and various public commissions, including the .125 mobile (1957) for the John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, Teodelapio (1962) for the city of Spoleto, Italy, and Flamingo (1973), a monumental red-painted steel stabile for the Federal Center Plaza in Chicago. In 1966, Calder published An Autobiography with Pictures, a witty illustrated account of the artist’s personal life and prolific artistic career. Calder died in 1976 at the age of seventy-eight, a few weeks after visiting a major retrospective of his work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.\nby Caterina Franciosi More ...\n Alexander Calder (/ˈkɔːldər/; July 22, 1898 – November 11, 1976) is widely considered to be one of the most important American sculptors of the 20th century. He is best known for his colorful, whimsical abstract public sculptures and his innovative mobiles, kinetic sculptures powered by motors or air currents, which embraced chance in their aesthetic. Born into a family of accomplished artists, Calder's work first gained attention in Paris in the 1930s and was soon championed by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, resulting in a retrospective exhibition in 1943. Major retrospectives were also held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1964) and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1974). Calder’s work is in many permanent collections, most notably in the Whitney Museum of American Art, but also the Guggenheim Museum; the Museum of Modern Art; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Centre Georges Pompidou. He produced many large public works, including .125 (at JFK Airport, 1957), Spirale (UNESCO in Paris, 1958), Flamingo and Universe (both in Chicago, 1974), and Mountains and Clouds (Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C., 1976). Although primarily known for his sculpture, Calder was a prodigious artist with a restless creative spirit, whose diverse practice included painting and printmaking, miniatures (such as his famous Cirque Calder), children’s book illustrations, theater set design, jewelry design, tapestries and rugs, and political posters. Calder was honored by the US Postal Service with a set of five 32-cent stamps in 1998, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, posthumously in 1977, after refusing to receive it from Gerald Ford one year earlier in protest of the Vietnam War. Alexander \"Sandy\" Calder was born in 1898 in Lawnton, Pennsylvania. His actual birthday, however, remains a source of much confusion. According to Calder's mother, Nanette (née Lederer), Calder was born on August 22, yet his birth certificate at Philadelphia City Hall, based on a hand-written ledger, stated July 22. When Calder's family learned about the birth certificate, they reasserted with certainty that city officials had made a mistake. Calder's grandfather, sculptor Alexander Milne Calder, was born in Scotland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1868, and is best known for the colossal statue of William Penn on top of Philadelphia City Hall's tower. His father, Alexander Stirling Calder, was a well-known sculptor who created many public installations, a majority of them in nearby Philadelphia. Calder's mother was a professional portrait artist, who had studied at the Académie Julian and the Sorbonne in Paris from around 1888 until 1893. She moved to Philadelphia, where she met Stirling Calder while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Calder's parents married on February 22, 1895; his sister, Mrs. Margaret Calder Hayes, was instrumental in the development of the UC Berkeley Art Museum. In 1902, Calder posed nude for his father’s sculpture The Man Cub, a cast of which is now located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. That same year he also completed his earliest sculpture, a clay elephant. Three years later, Stirling Calder contracted tuberculosis, and Calder's parents moved to a ranch in Oracle, Arizona, leaving the children in the care of family friends for a year. The children were reunited with their parents in late March 1906 and stayed at the ranch in Arizona until fall of the same year.

Flat, abstract shapes made in steel, boldly painted in a restricted primary palette, black or white, hang in perfect balance from wires. While the latent energy and dynamism of the mobiles remained of primary interest to Calder throughout his life, he also created important standing sculptures, which Jean Arp named “stabiles” to distinguish them from their ethereal kinetic counterparts. These works reject the weight and solidity of sculptural mass, yet displace space in a three–dimensional manner while remaining linear, open, planar, and suggestive of motion. Alexander Calder was born in 1898 in, Lawnton, Pennsylvania, and died in 1976 in New York. He received his B.S. in 1919 from Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken. From 1923 to 1925, Calder attended the Art Students League, New York, and in 1926, he attended the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, Paris. Calder's public commissions are on view in cities all over the world and his work has been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions, including the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

The installation marks the opening of Gagosian’s new gallery at rue de Castiglione and is part of FIAC Hors les Murs, which presents artworks in emblematic public spaces throughout the city. Flying Dragon (1975)—which exemplifies Calder’s capacity to invest a powerful visual dynamism in his work regardless of scale—is among the last of the monumental works he made. While static, the striking sculpture transforms when viewed from different angles. Constructed from sheet metal, it is physically weighty but appears delicate due to its limited points of contact with the ground.

{"id": 127, "data": "Alexander Calder AMERICAN, 1898–1976 The Arch is among the last of the monumental works Alexander Calder created before his death in 1976. Based on a nineteen-inch-high model that the artist conceived around 1940, The Arch was enlarged from a twelve-foot-high black-painted steel maquette in 1975. Its dramatic composition melds the biomorphic and architectonic aspects that characterize Calder’s work and creates an impressive, multi-layered image. The full-scale, painted steel sculpture is set in a field of tall native grasses. The open parabolic arch, an element from the vocabulary of building, is meant to entice visitors to pass through its portal and discover its buoyant forms from unexpected vantage points. Passage through Calder’s arch draws attention to the work itself as well as to the rural surroundings. The sculpture is composed of three elements: a bent “boomerang” on one side, joined by a central arch to a tall, concave fan shape, with an elongated upper portion capped by a small triangular “tail.” The work offers many different views, depending on the angle of approach. At certain vantage points, the black surface looks flat, punctuated by the many lines of bolts securing the steel. From another angle, the structurally supportive ribs give the inert steel structure a sense of grace and movement. The tall, triangular element seems to grow straight up from the ground, monumental but not overbearing. Calder is renowned as a pioneer of abstract sculpture. He studied mech-anical engineering before he attended the Art Students League in New York. His artistic sensibility flourished in the heady climate of 1920s Paris, where he befriended Joan Miró and Paul Klee. Calder’s mature works reflect these early influences in his combination of direct methods with Surrealist, often biomorphic, imagery. He began making abstract constructions after a visit to Piet Mondrian’s studio in 1930. A year later he conceived his first mobiles, a term invented by Marcel Duchamp to describe Calder’s new kinetic sculptures. Jean Arp, in response to Duchamp, dubbed Calder’s motionless painted metal constructions stabiles. During the 1960s and 1970s the stabiles gained colossal proportions, appropriate to the public sites for which they were often commissioned. The Arch was fabricated at Segre Ironworks in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1975, the year before Calder’s death. In spring 1978 The Arch arrived at Storm King as a loan from the Estate of Alexander Calder and Knoedler Gallery; it was acquired in 1982 and painted at Storm King. The work was placed on a slightly raised mound shaped by a few feet of gravel, a site created by the late William A. Rutherford, Sr., Storm King’s landscape architect. It sits in the same location today—on the left side of the road leading to the Museum Building. In the 1980s Rutherford designed a hillside near the Museum Building to expand exhibition space and create broad, gently sloping walking paths to sculptures located in the South Fields. Black Flag was installed on the site in 1999. Storm King has presented three exhibitions featuring works by Calder here, including a landmark installation of monumental sculpture outdoors, from 2001 through 2003. Occasionally the works on view on this hillside change. Five Swords, however, has been in the same location for more than twenty-five years.\n Alexander Calder\nThe Arch, 1975\nPainted steel\n50' x 41' 6\" x 34' 10\"\nPurchase Fund and gift of the Ralph E.

{"id": 128, "data": "Skip to Content Perhaps no artist has a larger presence at the National Gallery of Art than Alexander Calder. His monumental mobile, commissioned for the opening of the East Building, has become nearly as iconic as the building itself. A part of the East Building renovation and expansion, the Gallery’s Tower 2 galleries boast the world’s largest display of works by Alexander Calder with more than 40 sculptures and paintings, spanning the late 1920s through 1976, including 19 long-term loans from the Calder Foundation. Audio\nLECTURE: CALDER TOWER \nFebruary 26, 2017 Alexander S. C. Rower, Calder’s grandson and president, Calder Foundation, in conversation with Harry Cooper, curator and head, department of modern art, National Gallery of Art This program is coordinated with the Calder Foundation.\n After a 1930 visit to the studio of Piet Mondrian (whose work is on view on the Upper Level), Calder was inspired to create a series of oil paintings, seven of which are in the Tower installation. Calder was impressed not by the Dutch artist’s paintings but by the total studio environment he had designed. Preceding Calder’s invention of the mobile, these paintings are remarkable representations of his first venture into abstraction and do not resemble anything else within Calder’s oeuvre. In fall 1931, Marcel Duchamp paid a visit to Calder’s studio in Paris to see the younger artist’s latest works: abstract, motorized sculptures in wire and wood, which Duchamp famously dubbed “mobiles,” referring to both “motion” and “motive” in French. In summer 1934, just a year after moving to Roxbury, Connecticut, Calder made his first standing mobiles for the outdoors, prompting further development of monumental works. As Calder recounted in 1937, “I have made a number of things for the open air. All of them react to . . . the wind, and are like a sailing vessel in that they react best to one kind of breeze.” Other standing mobiles on view, intended for display indoors, include Small Feathers (1931), Little Spider (c. 1940), Rat (1948), and Four White Petals (1960). In the mid-1930s, in addition to developing his classic mobiles—many of which are dramatically presented in the Tower—Calder began to work on frames and panels that explored the concept of three-dimensional paintings in motion. Instigated by either natural forces or human intervention, movement of these compositions results in flashes of forms and colors, a complex choreography of elements that blurs the line between circumstance and permanence. Red Panel (1936) constitutes Calder’s largest “painting in motion.” The installation also includes Finny Fish (1948), which is made of wire, glass, a spoon, and a sardine-tin opener, among other objects. Several impressive “stabiles” are also on display, including Ruby-Eyed (1936) and Sphere Pierced by Cylinders (1939), as well as “standing mobiles” such as La vache (1970) and Crinkly Taureau (1970). Another highlight, on loan from the Foundation, is Eucalyptus (1940), a majestic hanging mobile that exemplifies Calder’s mature vocabulary. With a large, surreal element hanging in palpable tension with the floor, Eucalyptus premiered in Calder’s 1940 exhibition at Pierre Matisse Gallery and went on to be included in nearly all of the major exhibitions staged during the artist’s life. In addition to the works in the Tower 2 gallery and the atrium mobile, three Calder sculptures can be found around the Gallery’s campus: Obus (1972) was recently installed in the West Concourse Gallery; Tom’s (1974), on loan from the Calder Foundation, is on view outside the 7th Street entrance; and another loan from the Foundation, Cheval Rouge (1974), is installed in the Sculpture Garden.

The outdoor sculpture was installed for the inauguration of Mies van der Rohe’s iconic work of architecture and is now returning to the museum terrace for its reopening. The American modernist’s transformative mobiles, stabiles and standing mobiles range from the miniature to the monumental. This exhibition traces the unique relationship between size, scale and spatiality in Calder’s works, while juxtaposing his organic forms with the strict geometry of Mies van der Rohe’s building in a poetic dialogue. The open, experimental approach of the installation – which was specifically conceived for the Neue Nationalgalerie’s glass hall – relies on the participation of visitors, who will be able to experience some of Calder’s works in motion. Some of Calder’s works are activated at varying times, up to four times daily. The exhibition is made possible by the Freunde der Nationalgalerie.

{"id": 131, "data": "Artists / Makers / Authors > Alexander Calder.\nAlexander Calder Learn about ALEXANDER CALDER (1898-1976) artist,their past and upcoming works offered at auction at Christie's ‘Why must art be static?’ asked American-born sculptor Alexander Calder in 1932, the same year he exhibited his first now-iconic mobiles. ‘The next step in sculpture is motion.’ Masterpieces of abstraction and the first works of Kinetic Art, Calder’s revolutionary hanging sculptures, gently pivoted by the vagaries of the wind, had a profound effect on the development of modern sculpture. Together with his printmaking, painting, drawing and non-moving ‘stabile’ sculptures, Calder’s mobiles form a body of work now considered among the most important and valuable in 20th-century art. Born in Philadelphia and trained at the Art Student League in New York, Calder began his career as an illustrator, sketching sporting events and circus scenes for magazines. Drawing, printmaking and painting would remain an important facet of his work but by 1926, now dividing his time between New York and Paris, he had begun making animated toys and curious wire-and-wood figurines. Many of these would become Calder’s Circus (1926-32), a surrealist toy circus, performances of which earned Calder a following among the luminaries of Dadaism and Surrealism, many of whom, including Marcel Duchamp and Joan Miró, would remain champions and lifelong friends. In 1930, a visit to Piet Mondrian’s studio had a profound impact on the direction of Calder’s work. The playful figuration of his early Surrealist toys and sculptures gave way, not only to overt abstraction, but also to the colour and a draughtsman-like use of wire exampled in early pieces like Croisière (1931) and Mobile (c.1932). Over the following decades Calder would continue to explore his method of abstraction, finessing his mobiles and stabiles. As his reputation grew, he began to receive public commissions on a monumental scale. His mobile .125 (1957) in New York’s JFK airport and the colossal stabile Flamingo (1973), at Federal Center Plaza in Chicago, are vast works of public art. Yet they still contain all the wit and charm of the young Calder whose early career was spent making mechanical toys for his celebrated Surrealist circus.\n Upcoming lots by this artist No upcoming lots were found for Alexander Calder .\n Related Features 3 November 2021 | Article.\nAmerican Modernism in 7 themes.\n1 May 2021 | Article.\nPrecious Metals: Important Jewelry by Alexander Calder.\n24 June 2020 | Article.\nExpert view: Alexander Calder, The Mountain.\n23 June 2020 | Article.\nExpert view: Alexander Calder, Red Mobile.\n23 June 2020 | Article.\nExpert view: Alexander Calder, Horizontal.\n18 June 2020 | Article.\nThe art of friendship: Alexander Calder’s Sumac.\n1 June 2020 | Article.\nViewing Room | Make it Count: The Suñol Soler Collection.\n16 April 2020 | Article.\nHope in a strange world?

{"id": 133, "data": "Journal > Issues > Issue 5.\nWhen Parallel Lives Overlapped: Alexander Calder and Marino Marini Olivia Armandroff Marino Marini, Issue 5, May 2021 https://www.italianmodernart.org/journal/issues/marino-marini/.\nShare Abstract Alexander Calder and Marino Marini first encountered one another in 1950, during the Italian sculptor’s first visit to America. After this initial meeting, the two artists would continue to exchange correspondence for several years, especially during Calder’s participation in the 1952 Venice Biennale. Their social interactions developed out of their mutual friendship with and shared representation by the dealer Curt Valentin. As a result, both artists’ works were collected by the same patrons and displayed in spaces alongside one another, for example in Peggy Guggenheim’s Venice collection and that of Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., the owner of Fallingwater. Although art historical narratives have frequently focused on Marini as a sculptor looking backward, fascinated by the antique, and on Calder as an avant-garde innovator, breaking with traditional definitions of form, the similarities between the two artists—in their subjects and innovative techniques—demonstrate how both were men reflecting on their contemporary era. This article reflects upon surviving archival evidence from both the Calder Foundation and the Fondazione Marino Marini in Pistoia that illustrates their friendship.\n VIEW PDF   Art historical narratives have frequently framed Marino Marini as a sculptor looking backward, fascinated by the antique. In contrast, stories told about his contemporary Alexander Calder emphasize him as an avant-garde innovator, breaking with traditional definitions of form. While Calder’s mobiles thwart gravity, Marini’s sculptures have a weighty presence, or a solidity, and are firmly linked to the ground through the inspiration the artist derived from buried Etruscan antiquities. In some ways, both became standard-bearers for national identity: Marini engendering a second renaissance of Roman mythology and humanistic thinking; Calder wearing the mantle of American revolutionaries, with their rebellious nature and even youthful playfulness. A comparison between the two artists might initially appear incongruous, but the similarities between them are deeper than their two reputations might suggest. Both Marini and Calder catered to the same patrons, featured common subjects, and experimented with a wide range of techniques beyond sculpture, including print media. In truth, both men offered modern interpretations of historic traditions. If they were not directly influenced by one another, it seems possible these harmonies are indicative of how both men reflected their contemporary era’s preoccupations and concerns. Born three years apart, and dying within four years of one another, these two artists lived parallel lives on their respective continents. Marini and Calder were attracted to similar subjects. Marini’s consistent return to acrobats and jugglers mirrored Calder’s lifelong fascination with the circus. Both artists were similarly invested in animals as subjects, and while Calder was responsible for a more diverse sculpted menagerie, he depicted horses and equestrian subjects like Marini, who made the theme his life’s concentration. These preoccupations were not unique to Calder and Marini, but were instead part of a shared visual language of European modernists, reflecting the precedents set by earlier artists, especially Pablo Picasso.1 While art historical literature has increasingly differentiated between the work of Marini and Calder through time, connections were recognized by their contemporaries. Calder and Marini were collected by the same patrons and shared the same spaces of display, as in the collection of Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., the owner of the Frank Lloyd Wright–designed house Fallingwater, in Mill Run, Pennsylvania. Kaufmann displayed his horse and rider by Marini outside, under the cantilevered section of the house that hovers over Bear Creek, while Calder’s mobile, Little Tree (1942), was also part of Kaufmann’s collection.2 Peggy Guggenheim was also a powerful patron and advocate for both artists. She introduced Italians to Calder’s work in 1948, when her collection of modern sculpture was exhibited in Venice.3 As a result of the exhibition, Guggenheim chose to purchase the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni in Venice the following year.4 To inaugurate the space as one of display, Guggenheim organized a contemporary sculpture exhibition in the garden in 1949, where Calder’s work was again displayed. But Guggenheim chose to show Italian sculptors, including Marini, in addition to those sculptures she had previously collected.5 The Calder mobile Arc of Petals (figure 1), from 1941, appeared alongside Marini’s L’angelo della città (The Angel of the City; figure 2), which had just been completed in 1948. Today, in accordance with Guggenheim’s original placement, Marini’s sculpture stands guard on a terrace over the canal-side entrance to the museum. Inside, in the central hall, visible in juxtaposition to the equestrian sculpture, Calder’s mobile Arc of Petals has historically been displayed. As two significant anchors to the museum’s collection, these pieces have been in conversation for decades. Viewers throughout the institution’s history could follow the outstretched arms and inclined torso of Marini’s rider with their eyes, gazing upward toward the central hall’s ceiling, from which Calder’s mobile playfully rotates.

In the period when Guggenheim was drawing a connection between Marini and Calder, the dealer Curt Valentin was making a similar association. Valentin came to represent Marini as his dealer in New York City, and in 1950 he hosted the first solo exhibition of Marini’s work at his Buchholz Gallery.6 Valentin was an immigrant from Berlin and known for his roster of European modernist artists – including Henry Moore, Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Juan Gris – and he fostered these connections in annual collecting tours on the continent.7 But Valentin also long represented Calder, having given him his first solo exhibition, in 1944. In his autobiography, Calder described his unique collaboration with the dealer, noting that Valentin represented few Americans. An archival photograph of Valentin’s apartment (figure 3) demonstrates that he, like Guggenheim, saw aesthetic similarities between the two artists: one of Marini’s Pomonas, a series of sculptures dedicated to the female nude and, in name, the Etruscan goddess of fertility, is positioned beneath a Calder mobile.8 The Pomona’s upturned gaze again draws a connection with the overhanging work. In the photograph, the shadows of the two art pieces on the wall bring the works even closer together. Figure 3. Curt Valentin’s apartment, not after 1954. Photographic print, 9 7/8 x 8 17/64 in.

The significance of Valentin in both Calder’s and Marini’s lives is documented by the visual memorials both artists made to their shared dealer. Calder created a 1944 drawing of Valentin, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.9 The wiry, black ink lines and concentric circles framing Valentin’s eyes recall Calder’s curvilinear wire sculptures from the time, equating the dealer with the artwork he was responsible for on behalf of Calder. Marini’s dedication to Valentin is evident in the sculpture he made of him in 1954 (figure 4), a bronze head that now resides in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. In these efforts, Calder and Marini were not alone, and other artists who built friendships with and relied upon Valentin, such as André Masson, honored him with portraits as well.10 Figure 4. Marino Marini, “Curt Valentin”, 1954. Bronze, height: 9 1/8 in. (23.2 cm). New York, Museum of Modern Art.   Valentin was responsible for fostering a personal connection between Marini and Calder. For Marini’s 1950 exhibition at the Buchholz Gallery, the Italian sculptor embarked on his first and only trip to the United States. During this visit, Calder and his wife, Louisa, invited Marini to their home in Roxbury, Connecticut.11 After this encounter, the two artists would continue to cultivate their relationship through correspondence that was friendly and conversational in tone. Collections in the Calder Foundation and the Fondazione Marino Marini in Pistoia chronicle this friendship.  The first in their preserved series of correspondence dates from 1951, when Calder wrote in Italian to Marini and his wife Marina, attributing his decision to study the language to their visit to his home in Roxbury.12  Subsequent exchanges remained fond. In 1952, Calder sent the couple a postcard featuring a technicolor image of the Statue of Liberty.13 On the back he playfully wrote in Italian again, drawing an image of a fish. Not long after, Calder had reason to visit Italy and practice his Italian. In 1952, he represented the United States in the Venice Biennale, winning the grand prize for sculpture.14 For this, Marini wrote a postcard to Calder, congratulating him on his success.15 Calder responded with a lengthy letter in French in November of that year, mentioning the compliments he received for the award but admitting he didn’t understand the Biennale or Italian taste.16 The correspondence between the two artists continued into 1953.17 But Calder and Marini had a new reason to write in 1954, when Valentin visited Italy in the summer. Photographs of Marini and Valentin, presumably from this trip, are a part of the papers of Valentin and his assistant Jane Wade Sabersky, held by MoMA and the Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art.18 The trip ended suddenly when Valentin suffered a heart attack and passed away. Marini attended the funeral and corresponded with the dealer’s global contacts. Wade informed Calder of Valentin’s untimely death, and Calder in turn wrote to Marini, expressing his sorrow and sympathies and admitting he had not seen Valentin in a year.19 Marini would respond to Calder, sending him a letter that chronicled the funeral in Italy.20 Wade corresponded with others, too, regarding Valentin’s death and Marini’s involvement in the funeral, including Will Grohmann, the German art critic.21 In his letter, Grohmann proposed a memorial publication honoring Valentin. For its frontispiece he proposed the portrait of Valentin by Marini, requesting that Wade send him a good image of the sculpture. Marini’s bust was not simply recognized by the friends and companions of Valentin as a means of remembering and commemorating the dealer: the following year, Marini donated the bust to the MoMA, likely in honor of Valentin’s death. In a similar way, Valentin posthumously honored the artists whom he had represented: in 1956 his collection entered MoMA’s, including a lithograph of Marini’s Cavallo (Horse, 1952 figure 5). Valentin’s gift on behalf of Marini and Marini’s gift on behalf of Valentin remain together in the collection today. Figure 5. Marino Marini, “Cavallo” [Horse], 1952. Lithograph, 11 3/16 x 8 3/8 in. New York, Museum of Modern Art. There is little evidence of a continued connection between Calder and Marini after Valentin’s death. A final exchange is documented in the collection of the Calder Foundation: in May of 1955, the two artists corresponded, and Marini asked when they would see one another again.22 Calder eventually returned to Italy to engage in a series of projects in Spoleto, first in 1958, to construct sets for a ballet to be performed during the Festival dei Due Mondi (Festival of Two Worlds), and again in 1962, to complete a fifty-eight-foot-tall stabile, Teodelapio, for the Spoleto Festival.23 For the project, Calder developed a closer relationship with the Italian art critic Giovanni Carandente, also a personal friend of Marini, who recommended Calder for subsequent commissions, among them to develop a work for the stage of the Teatro dell’Opera in Rome, working with the artistic director Massimo Bogianckino.24 Yet during these trips, there is no record of Calder and Marini reuniting. Despite this, the two artists would have remained aware of one another, likely following one another’s careers from afar, until Calder’s death in 1976. Ultimately, Calder and Marini were concerned with similar subjects and exhibited a common investment in experimentation. Their representation by the same gallerist, their patronage by certain collectors, and their mutual connections to figures in the art world suggest that both artists appealed to a distinct set of tastes in the mid-twentieth century. Both crossed the Atlantic and toured one another’s countries. While they had few personal interactions, it seems that both artists exhibited the ethos of their era. Responding to the demands of their time, Marini and Calder were typical of the modern artist, especially the modern sculptor.

Carmen is a monumental standing mobile, which follows the typology Alexander Calder began in 1958 with La Spirale, which he built for the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. It consists of a fixed supporting section with a mobile structure on top. Eight riveted blades are moved by air currents, giving the piece the playful, optimistic component so essential to Calder’s art while also producing a spontaneous contrast between the aesthetic industrial solidity of the base and the variability of the upper part. Like other pieces by the artist, the title of Carmen is a woman’s name, which, while it certainly has literary and musical connotations, does not make the sculpture a simple illustration, but actually functions as an independent work, as pointed out by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1946: “Calder does not ‘suggest’ anything: it captures genuine living movements and shapes them. ‘Mobiles’ have no meaning, make you think of nothing but themselves. They are, that is all; they are absolutes.”\n    Carmen Fernández Aparicio.\n1937-1943 Room 205.09.\n1936 1969.\n1937-1947 (circa) Room 205.08.\n1969 Room 411.\nSee all the artworks.\nRelated visits Other ways to explore the Collection from different points of view.

Minimal/Maximal. The exhibition curated by Joachim Jäger, Udo Kittelmann, and Maike Steinkamp is realised in close collaboration with the Calder Foundation, New York. The American Modernist Calder’s abstract kinetic art sculptures - from miniature to monumental scale - are in a lyrical harmony with the architecture of the museum designed by German-American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. It is worth mentioning that aesthetic sensibility practice by the contemporaries Calder and Mies van der Rohe casts a profound influence on American Modernist architecture and art, which is still emulated by experts in the same fields.

We have reduced the exhibition architecture to a minimum. In addition, we set some of the sculptures in motion every day so that the objects can enter into an active dialogue with the surrounding space and the visitors.” Louisa’s 43rd Birthday Present, 1948, Sheet metal, wood, wire, felt, cigar box, and paint Image: Courtesy of 2021 Calder Foundation, New York / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York.\nWhen steel production was on the rise in the 1950s, it offered the artist an opportunity to play with the design and scale of his craft. Large scale installations including Les Trois Ailes, Les manTriangles and Five Swords testify the same. The colour, form, scale and movement of the sculpture forge an interactive dialogue with the audience. The works in motion by Calder at the glass hall of Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin have been installed with an experimental approach to allow the viewers to lead an immersive experience around them. To note, the principle of openness integral to the architecture of Mies van der Rohe is also reflected in the complexity of Calder’s work. Alexander Calder in his Roxbury studio Image: Herbert Matter, Courtesy of 2021 Calder Foundation, New York / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York.\nThe interactive installations by Calder are not simple sculptures in situ, but as an ‘active medium’, they are made keeping the viewers in mind. Irrespective of the size of the sculptures, the viewers experience their sense of space having a twist as they walk around the museum. The works such as Blizzard, Otto’s Mobile and Le Cagoulard embedded with kinetic quality are in the constant journey to alter the given architectural setting of their immediate house. The small sculptures outside their conventional cases are put on the display in such a manner that they seem to be in a performance. This manoeuvres the viewers to have an open engagement with the work and relook at the changing surroundings around them. An array of the facsimile chess sets, published by Cahiers d’Art in collaboration with the Calder Foundation on the occasion of this exhibition, is made available to chess-playing visitors.

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe / VG-Bildkunst, Bonn 2021.\nEven if the conceptual themes of abstract art and minimal art play an immensely important role to define the form of the sculptures, it was the social engagement that Calder pursued through his works. Steinkamp mentions, “Calder was one of the first artists to actively involve the viewers in his work – he was making them participants by inviting them to actively interact with his objects. This social participation is a central aspect of Calder work and this is, in my opinion, what makes Calder's work still relevant to contemporary artists today.” During the opening days of the exhibition, the visitors could behold the beauty of the Calder BMW Art Car painted with radiant colours with a sensitive emphasis on organic forms. The automobile served as another art installation to underscore the kinetic quality of the works by Calder.

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe / VG-Bildkunst, Bonn 2021.\nCalder’s journey as a contemporary artist is rooted in the thought to create art as a way to invite the audience to explore the multiple possibilities around it. The pieces made in the hands of Calder look for inclusion – in terms of engagement with the audience – rather than exclusivity exuded by the elitist arts. This is a common ground running between the arts of modernist sculptor Calder and architect Mies van der Rohe: open the world for conversation. Steinkamp opines, “The exhibition is surely the unique experience of the described aspects of Calder's work in the strict architecture by Mies van der Rohe's Neue Nationalgalerie, which can only be experienced here.” With this, the exhibition aims to have viewers arrive at a similar point of interaction with the art sculptures in an effort to shift their trained perspective on architectural settings. 3 Segments, 1973, Sheet metal, rod, wire, and paint Image: David von Becker, Courtesy of 2021 Calder Foundation, New York / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.

{"id": 140, "data": "Calder Now Nov. 21, 2021 – May 29, 2022 Hal 2.\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"? Combined Shape Created with Sketch.\n share.\nxml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"? Group Created with Sketch.\n Calder Now! A sensational exhibition about Alexander Calder’s influence on contemporary art. Miraculous, gravity-defying installations, sculptures that cause amazing optical illusions, and works that appeal to all the senses. Apart from twenty sculptures by the modern master, discover installations, performances, and sculptures by ten international, contemporary artists. This must-see exhibition shows how Calder’s innovative mind has been a source of inspiration for many generations after him. The American artist Alexander Calder (1898-1976) was one of the great innovators in modern art and a pioneer of kinetic art. He was the first to take sculptures from their pedestals, suspending them in mid-air. Included in the exhibition are his iconic mobiles and stabiles, as well as motorized and sonorous sculptures. Light and reflection, sound, ephemera, gravity and architecture: these are important themes from Calder’s oeuvre that are echoed in the work of the artists of today. The works of the renowned artists Olafur Eliasson, Žilvinas Kempinas, Simone Leigh, Ernesto Neto, Carsten Nicolai, Roman Signer, Aki Sasamoto, Monika Sosnowska, Sarah Sze, and Rirkrit Tiravanija reveal new connections in Calder’s iconic oeuvre. Calder Now will add a new and adventurous chapter to the story of modern and contemporary art. Firsts Some of the works were especially made for ‘Calder Now’ and will be shown to the public for the very first time at the Kunsthal. In the spring of 2021, Aki Sasamoto (Japan, 1980) spent four months as an artist in residence at the Atelier Calder in Saché, France. There she created ‘Squirrel Ways’, a piece on the cutting edge of installation and performance. On several occasions during the exhibition, Sasamoto will deliver her performance in the architectural installation.\n In keeping with the rest of his work, Rirkrit Tiravanija (Argentina, 1961) has created the accessible and participative piece ‘untitled 2021 (le jeu de l’araignée rouge)’. In the exhibition space, visitors will encounter a billiards table with one white, one yellow, one blue and multiple red balls, and everyone is invited to play a game of billiards. With nothing more than a wall, magnetic tape and a fan, the artist Žilvinas Kempinas (Lithuania, 1969) has created a dynamic and constantly changing installation called ‘Flaming Tape’ (2021). The kinetic work is activated by air currents that set the strips of tape in motion like a 3D drawing. Carsten Nicolai (Germany, 1965) aims to make complicated processes of time, sound, and space accessible and visible to the spectator. In ‘Calder Now’ his impressive installation ‘pionier I’ (2011) will be shown. At intervals, a sizeable, white silk parachute is blown up by a wind machine, simultaneously flooding the Kunsthal’s large HALL 2 with sound. Experiences that stimulate the senses The use of humble materials is what connects the work of Simone Leigh (United States, 1967) to that of Calder. Leigh finds inspiration in West African and Native American ceramics traditions. She uses materials like cowrie shells, roses and raffia. The histories and experiences of Black women play an important role in Leigh’s work. In 2022, the artist will be representing the United States during the 59th Venice Biennale.\n Ernesto Neto (Brazil, 1964) appeals to all the senses with his immersive and sensuous installation ‘It Happens When the Body is Anatomy of Time’ (2000). Like diagonal columns, enormous Lycra tulle sacks filled with fragrant cloves, cumin and saffron are stretched between the floor and the ceiling. Olafur Eliasson (Denmark, 1967) uses natural phenomena such as light and reflection for his research into perception. With his sensory installations he aims to directly involve the spectator in his work. In the exhibition he will be presenting two very different works: ‘Black and yellow double polyhedron lamp’ (2011), and ‘The lost compass’ (2013). Roman Signer (Switzerland, 1938) takes inconspicuous, everyday objects and transforms these into imaginative and surprising pieces. A white shirt, for instance, with the sleeve lifted up by a helium-filled balloon (‘Hemd’, 1995), or a bent organ pipe (‘Orgelpfeife’, 2020). Experimentation and energetic activation are central to his humorous work that offers unexpected perspectives on the world around us. ‘Still Life with Desk’ (2013-2015) by the American artist Sarah Sze (1969) manifests itself to the public like a moment frozen in time. With this installation made of wire and objects, such as photographs, stationary, and disposable cups, Sze researches the construction and measurability of time and space. And Monika Sosnowska (1972) transforms architectural traces of post-war Poland – her native country – into elegant shapes. On the one hand her ‘Gate’ sculptures appear to be heavy, but on the other they also seem weightless and light-hearted when suspended from the ceiling. Book your ticket here! Catalogue On the occasion of the exhibition ‘Calder Now’, and in collaboration with the Calder Foundation, Kunsthal Rotterdam and Lannoo publishers are releasing a richly illustrated catalogue of the same title (in Dutch and English). This catalogue will pay ample attention to Calder’s life and work, as well as to the ten contemporary artists. It includes essays by the artist, composer, and curator Gryphon Rue, the academic Donatien Grau, and guest curators Dieter Buchhart and Anna Karina Hofbauer. The 192-page publication will be available at the Kunsthal Shop for € 39.99 (ISBN Dutch edition: 978 94014 79684, ISBN English edition: 978 94014 79677).\n Collaboration The exhibition is realised in close collaboration with guest curators Dieter Buchhart and Anna Karina Hofbauer, and the Calder Foundation.\n Ernesto Neto, It happens when the body is anatomy of time, 2000, National Galleries of Scotland, photo: Ossip van Duivenbode ©Ossip Alexander Calder, Gray Stones, Red Stalk, ca. 1948 Photograph courtesy of Calder Foundation, New York / Art Resource, New York. © 2021 Calder Foundation, New York / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / Pictoright, Amsterdam.\n Alexander Calder Blue Feather, ca. 1948  Photograph by Stephen White courtesy of Calder Foundation, New York / Art Resource, New York. © 2021 Calder Foundation, New York / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / Pictoright, Amsterdam.

{"id": 141, "data": "Alexander Calder: Master of movement “Just as one can compose colors, or forms, so one can compose motions.” \nAlexander Calder.\nIt is difficult to escape the sensual spell of Calder’s signature mobile sculptures. Their recognisable nature provokes fascination and wonder about gravity, craft and form. With a background in mechanical engineering, the artist developed an unprecedented understanding of the interplay between geometric structures, biomorphic forms and contours that evoke surrealistic imagery that come to life through three-dimensional engineering. The confrontation between viewer and sculpture established Calder’s legacy as one that almost singularly dominated the market landscape of American kinetic and modernist sculpture during his lifetime. The recently inaugurated Calder Archive of the Calder Foundation provides an extraordinary insight into the artist’s remarkable life and bibliography.

With an artist, there’s no such thing as perfect.” Born in 1898 in a small town in Lawnton, Pennsylvania, Alexander Calder grandfather and father were both well-known sculptors and his mother a professional portrait artist. With this early artistic influence and creative environment, Calder created artworks throughout his childhood, experimenting with sheets of brass, for example. During the artist’s high school years, the Calder family relocated to both California and New York, where his parents provided him with his own studio space to accelerate his creativity. Despite this encouragement, his parents did not want him to become an artist, and Calder consequently decided to study mechanical engineering. About this decision, the artist was quoted saying: “I was not very sure what this term meant, but I thought I’d better adopt it”, “I wanted to be an engineer because some guy I rather liked was a mechanical engineer, that’s all”. After receiving his degree, the artist held various jobs, including being a hydraulic engineer or working as a mechanic on a passenger ship in 1922. After taking a job back on land, as a timekeeper at a logging camp in Aberdeen, Washington, Calder was inspired by the mountain landscape, and his passion for the arts began to reignite. In New York, he enrolled at the Art Students League, where he studied alongside artists such as George Luks. After relocating to Paris in 1926, Calder created some of his leitmotifs featuring key subjects such as the circus.\n Calder photographed in front of his painting, Untitled (Boxing at the Madison Square Garden Gymnasium), New York, 1924 via © 2021 Calder Foundation, New York.

Additionally the artist spend lengthy times drawing hundreds of animals at the Bronx and Central Park zoos.\n Alexander Calder, Romulus and Remus, 1928.

In 1931 the artist’s first exhibition was held at Galerie Percier, for which Léger wrote the preface of the show’s catalogue. In 1933 Calder and his wife return to the US. The next decades the artist spent travelling and rejected from joining the troops during the Second World War, he continued to develop his sculptural practice due to the scarcity of aluminium during the war, returning to carved wood as a medium.\n Calder arriving with a bundle of his wire sculptures to present at Galerie Neumann-Nierendorf, Berlin, 1929 via © 2021 Calder Foundation, New York.\n Calder assembling Five Rods and Nine Discs (1936), Roxbury, summer 1938 Photograph by Herbert Matter © Calder Foundation, New York via © 2021 Calder Foundation, New York.

His painterly body of work exposes artistic studies that explore geometric forms and bold colours. These two-dimensional works investigated composition on a flat surface, exploring colour and line. In addition to his prominent sculptural body, Calder painted throughout his artistic career. After a period of drawing in the 1920s in New York, the artist’s painterly practice developed into pure abstraction. Protesting the Vietnam war later in his career, in the late 1960s, Calder developed his print practice producing posters. “If you can imagine a thing, conjure it up in space then you can make it… The universe is real but you can’t see it. You have to imagine it. Then you can be realistic about reproducing it.”.\nDetail of: Alexander Calder, Untitled, 1930.\n Calder was famously inspired by a visit to the studio of Dutch painter Piet Mondrian in 1930. Following this seminal encounter, Calder’s practice shifted towards abstraction, adapting compositions and innovative actuations of space. During those years, the artist invented the first kinetic sculpture that he referred to as “mobile”, a term first coined by Marcel Duchamp. This terminology encompasses both “motive” and “motion”. His earliest experimentations included mechanical motors, which the artist quickly abandoned, devoting the aura of his works to the interplay with natural forces such as humidity, light, air currents and human interaction. “It was a very exciting room. Light came in from the left and from the right, and on the solid wall between the windows there were experimental stunts with colored rectangles of cardboard tacked on. Even the victrola, which had been some muddy color, was painted red. I suggested to Mondrian that perhaps it would be fun to make these rectangles oscillate. And he, with a very serious countenance, said: “No, it is not necessary, my painting is already very fast.” This one visit gave me a shock that started things. Though I had heard the word “modern” before, I did not consciously know or feel the term “abstract.” So now, at thirty-two, I wanted to paint and work in the abstract. And for two weeks or so, I painted very modest abstractions. At the end of this, I reverted to plastic work which was still abstract.”.\nAlexander Calder, Untitled, 1934. Alexander Calder, Tightrope, 1936. In 1963 Calder created series of works that included some of his most monumental sculptures. The artist created his first outdoor sculptures as early as 1934 in his Roxbury, Connecticut studio. Within his sculptural oeuvre, the large-scale sculptures are constructed with the same materials and techniques as Calder’s smaller, fragile mobile structures. In the late 1930s after committing to work on a smaller scale, the artist’s devoted himself to the creation of his “maquettes”, which were later translated to monumental size. These monumental works were undoubtedly inspired by his father’s and grandfather’s practice who worked as traditional sculptors. Specifically, Calder drew inspiration from traditional technique when seeking a way to enlarge his compositions that were drawn on craft paper and enlarged by using a grid system, staying in line with the exact specifications.\n Calder painting Untitled with Les Triangles in the foreground, Le Carroi studio, Saché, 1963 Photograph by Ugo Mulas © Ugo Mulas Heirs via © 2021 Calder Foundation, New York.

The artist explores how a person and their physical presence in space can be described from various methodological perspectives. The work “Self-Portrait” consists of 24 glass ampoules containing, in pure form, the chemical elements that make up the human body. There is a large installation based on the artist’s fully sequenced DNA, printed out on 314,000 pages of paper. The human genome in the digital era is also the theme of the bronze stelae: here the artist has shaped numerous overlapping smartphones into a double helix. The central piece locates an individual physically in time and space. A ring of black steel in the middle of the hall reaches almost to the ceiling. 24 loudspeakers have been mounted on it and transmit the artist’s heartbeat into the exhibition room. The show was conceptualised in 2019 and was originally scheduled for spring 2020, but the opening was postponed until autumn 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n In the book accompanying the exhibition, Kwade presents historical and contemporary illustrations of some of those systems which serve directly or indirectly as a reference framework for her works. The visual material ranges from anatomical drawings and historical maps to atomic structures seen through an electron microscope. Like Kwade’s works themselves, these illustrations are aesthetic visualisations of abstract scientific and philosophical theories. The chosen images thus constitute both a collection of materials and a record of the research process undertaken by the artist. At the same time, they create a subtext that connects with the works to form narrative structures. Kwade’s site-specific installation in the first big exhibition hall is the latest addition to the successful format devoted by the Berlinische Galerie to in-situ projects by contemporary artists working in this city. Kwade studied at Berlin’s University of the Arts from 1999 to 2005 and is now one of the most sought-after artists in the international arena. She has recently exhibited in, among other places, New York, Tours, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Zurich, Barcelona, Shanghai, Reykjavik, Venice and London.\n Exhibition catalogue Purchase the catalogue for the exhibition \"Alicja Kwade.

{"id": 148, "data": "Name Alicja Kwade Images IGNANT Production Words Steph Wade.\nIn recent years, in Berlin’s southeast district of Oberschöneweide, a historic disused production hall was converted and revived into a creative hub by various London and Berlin-based architects. Here, seconds from the river Spree, three large industrial warehouses were transformed in 2017 into studio space for Polish-German visual artist Alicja Kwade: a sought-after contemporary artist of our time, whose work has been exhibited in galleries, museums, and private collections across the world. Although the neighborhood’s landscape still looks a little mechanical, with its towering factory halls and power plants, there’s no denying this part of the city’s appeal—with endless art studios, culture experiences, and dance parties sprouting up in what is now considered trendy real estate: warehouses and former production mills. Despite the fact that a little over a decade ago this area was considered extremely underdeveloped in terms of opportunities, like other areas of Berlin, the future for artists is bright—and those like Kwade have been able to buy, as opposed to rent, their spaces. In Berlin, the future is bright—and artists like Kwade have been able to buy, as opposed to rent, their spaces Inside the light-filled, high-ceilinged brick and glass walls of her studio, people operating heavy machinery and angle grinders call the artist over to check something on an in-progress sculpture, asking her opinion over the noise on the texture of the piece’s surface. Massive wooden boxes and crates are stacked on top of one another, and there are parts of various works in different stages of production scattered all across the dusty room: like many of her enormous spherical sculptures, the pieces can only be moved with forklifts. In another room, five-meter-high shelves hold the weight of tree trunks, stones measuring a ton, and huge sheets of wood; materials that will be used for future artworks not yet in motion. More than 20 people work together in a team on multiple projects at once to produce large-scale works of steel, stone, wood, and metal. Yet no matter what type of sculpture or site-specific installation Kwade has conceived of, there are certain elements that reoccur in her practice: a compelling interest in everyday objects; an exploration of time, space, and matter; and a dose of irony and humor to balance out what she feels is the absurdity of human existence. “If I look at a stone, a star, or whatever, my research is always the same—to understand why things appear, how they appear” “For me, human beings are quite satirical creatures somehow, there’s just no way to get it,” she replies, when I ask her if we’ll ever understand the point of why we’re here. With Kwade, there is no time for small talk, so we get straight into the hard-hitting questions. The artist, who is in her early 40s, has a kind smile and a focused directness about her when she speaks, a trait that is perhaps indicative of someone who builds very precise constructions for a living. “If I look at a stone, a star, or whatever, my research is always the same—to try to understand why things appear, how they appear, and why we believe them,” she says, sitting on a chair encircled by a large collection of architectural models. We are in her office on the second floor of one of the buildings, which is spread across three stories: The ground floor with its kitchen for group meetings and communal eating (which has been scaled back in numbers of eaters at one time since the start of the pandemic); the second floor where her desk is, a modest space surrounded by hundreds of sketches and models; and above it, another small room with a bathroom, terrace, and kitchen, for when the artist needs alone time to withdraw, sketch, make calls, or research. It is Kwade’s particular talent for making complex things feel familiar that makes her work so intriguing Kwade moved to Germany from Poland when she was eight years old. In the last two decades, she has since earned acclaim for her immersive architectural installations and sculptures, yet it is her particular talent for making complex things feel familiar that makes her work so intriguing. Her current exhibition at Berlinische Galerie, ‘In Abwesenheit’ (In Absence) for example, uses philosophical, scientific, and social enquiry to comment on how a person and their physical presence in space can be described through information.

Courtesy the artist and Berlinische Galerie.\n Her sculptures and constructs displayed at the exhibition inform our perceptions of the elements and information that make up the human body: one piece, titled Principium (2020), uses what looks like discarded smartphones twisted into three life-sized double helices of our DNA. However just one iPhone was 3D-scanned and the form was used to digitally “I’m just looking at myself as one example of a human being”build these life-sized double helices, and their form was then cast in bronze. Another piece, called Self-Portrait (2020), consists of 24 tiny glass ampoules containing in pure form the chemical composition of the human body, with tiny powders and crystals of hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and so on. A third piece, an enormous ring of black steel, is dotted with 24 speakers that blast the artist’s heartbeat across the exhibition hall. It is a physical manifestation of the body’s information; thus, with it, Kwade is looking at how a human being can be described. Exhibition view \"Alicja Kwade. In Absence\", Photo: © Roman März. Courtesy the artist and Berlinische Galerie. “I don’t care about where I came from or where I've been raised, I’m not interested in those details” Despite being referred to as a series of self-portraits, Kwade stresses that the pieces in the exhibition are not about her. “It’s kind of funny, you know, but I’m not interested in myself at all,” she explains. “I don’t care about where I came from or where I’ve been raised, I’m not interested in those details. I’m more looking at myself as one example of a human being, and I’m just trying to see what that is made of, and to look for some authenticity in the materials in the process.” Back at the studio, there is no clear or structured procedure that leads each day. “What I can say is that I try to get in some quiet hours during the day or on the weekend, to work on my creative process,” she says, “which means looking at all “I have a deep interest in finding out what is not to be found out”the works, researching, learning, reading, and sketching.” Multiple project managers will work with her simultaneously to develop ideas in more detail, “because they can work more efficiently on the computer than I can,” she laughs. Then there is communication with curators, registrars, engineers, and directors, and more—“All the in-between process is quite exhausting because it’s usually about solving problems,” she says. “This part can be very stressful, because you have to be very precise about things until the very end. But my favorite part of the process is here, when everything is ready and you see it come together.” The important part Kwade hopes we take away from her way of creating is to continue to question why things are the way they are. “There was a certain point where I started to question things and not just believe them,” she says. “I grew up in a country where everybody’s Catholic like crazy, so they just believe things without questioning them. I started to hate that when I was a child, and began to refuse to accept it.” “When you start to question things, you always end up in the solar system. Everything ends there anyway” Her planetary sculpture ParaPivot (2019) on the Roof Garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City is one of her boldest and most iconic works to date. Given the fact that the piece makes us ponder an otherwise unfathomable universe, I ask where her interest in the solar system came from—was it there since her childhood? “How that came about, I have no idea,” she laughs. “It’s more that I have a deep interest in finding out what is not to be found out, because it’s so abstract that we can’t understand it anyway. And of course when you start to question things, you always end up in the solar system. Everything ends there anyway.” ParaPivot (2019). Photo: Roman März, courtesy Alicja Kwade.

König Seoul takes the first half, Sometimes I Prefer to Sit on a Chair on the Earth: a sentence that is embodied in Siège du Monde (2021): a wooden seat under which rests a planet-like marbled orb, whose striking colours range from maroon to white.

Does this marble sphere represent another version of the world in a parallel universe? And who is this 'I' who prefers to sit on a chair on the earth? Questions like these amplify a sense of curiosity about where the artist is taking us.

Photo: Cheonho Ahn.\n In the middle of the gallery, the sculptural work Duodecuple Be-Hide (2021) confirms that this is an exhibition—a space—that one cannot know entirely, since all of its elements signify a kind of motion. Twelve stones form a circle on the floor with double-sided rectangular mirrors standing between each of them. There are three types of stone: sandstone, granite, and bronze, the latter alternating between a green and gold patina.

Kwade's focus on the multiplicity of space in Duodecuple Be-Hide leads to an examination of time in the new 'Entropie' series (2021), in which watch hands are assembled onto paper.  Exhibition view: Alicja Kwade, Sometimes I Prefer to Sit on a Chair on the Earth , König, Seoul (10 December 2021–22 January 2022). Courtesy the artist and König Galerie. Photo: Cheonho Ahn.\n Each work expresses a specific period of time, with more watch hands incorporated into works expressing longer periods, as in Entropie (71 days 12 hours), in which the hands form concentric circles, while more free arrangements see hands bump into each other in Entropie (98 days 15 hours). In a world that tends to make order out of its absence (or at least tries to), Kwade observes countless earthly phenomena and places them in the context of their entropic chaos. Entropy is a scientific concept that is immeasurable, a state of disorder; perhaps the very principle of uncertainty. In keeping, these self-operating watch hands are assembled to create 'unstructured and entropic complexity'.1  Alicja Kwade, Entropie (71 days 12 hours) (2021).

Viewers can make assumptions about their variations, but they just become yet more variables. The theme of multiplying time and space continues at Pace Gallery, which takes the second half of the exhibition's title, Surrounded by Universes.

The length of each measurement is indicated in each work's title—such as Rain (20cm) and Rain (30cm)—continuing the theme of logging measurements within artwork titles.

The result is the visualisation of scales that collide and then resettle; a planet in perpetual motion. Such that the nine black ceramic sculptures scattered over the third floor, which look like variations of chess pieces or toy-top spinners, seem to be in motion, even if they are static.

Courtesy the artist and Pace Gallery.\n Ocula Insight Huma Bhabha’s Monstrous Humanity Read More.\nTitled All at any Time (2018), it is easy to imagine these forms dividing or multiplying like Kwade's other works—a testament to the artist's concern with interfering in temporal perceptions. As Kwade has said, 'My work starts where I stop understanding.'2 On the gallery terrace, Multi-Teller (20) (Orgel) (2018) consists of several blue-toned macauba balls resembling the earth resting on the ground, which seem to have emerged from uniform rows of several stainless-steel pipes of different lengths embedded in two concrete rectangles.  Alicja Kwade, Multi-Teller (20) (Orgel) (2018). Exhibition view: Surrounded by Universes , Pace Gallery, Seoul (10 December 2021–22 January 2022). Courtesy the artist and Pace Gallery.\n The sculpture appears like some sort of oven that bakes planets rather than bread: a diagram of a multiverse where multiple worlds exist in tandem, with each scattered orb becoming evidence of a constant process of earth-making. Perhaps this is another type of measuring unit. A scaling that speaks to philosopher Byung-Chul Han's observation that information deforms the world rather than illuminating it, levelling the boundary between true and false.  Alicja Kwade, Multi-Teller (20) (Orgel) (2018) (detail). Exhibition view: Surrounded by Universes , Pace Gallery, Seoul (10 December 2021–22 January 2022). Courtesy the artist and Pace Gallery.\n While the multiplications of time and space in Kwade's works provide an abundance of information, they do not propose linear interpretations. Rather, what emerges in these investigations of planetary phenomena is a multiversal perspective of atomic matter that constantly bewilders. —[O] 1 Levi R.

WerkRaum. 25 20.06.2008 to 24.08.2008 Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum für Gegenwart - Berlin Made possible by the Piepenbrock Unternehmensgruppe and Museum & Location\n The artist Alicja Kwade, this year's winner of the Piepenbrock Price for Sculpture, works in a multi-faceted and original way, employing a number of different media (installation, sculpture, photography, video) and materials. Her art work makes use of classic sculpture materials as well as of objects of everyday usage, distorted to rip them out of their usual context and meaning. Coal briquets are turned into gold barrels, pebbles into precious stones, pavement stones into diamonds. In doing so, Alicja Kwade poses questions of auhtenticity and value, perception and classification. Over and again, she engages with matters of physics, such as the representation of the visible and the invisible. At the same time, her art combines science with poetry and playfulness.\n Organizer Nationalgalerie Related Links Pressefotos Pressemitteilung Katharina Fritzsch und Alicja Kwade erhalten die Piepenbrock Skulpturenpreise 2008.\nShare Facebook Twitter Pinterest Whatsapp Telegram E-Mail.\nAbout Cookies This website uses cookies.

{"id": 152, "data": "Alicja Kwade news.\nAlicja Kwade invades corporate New York tower with celestial sculpture A 22,000 kilogram spherical stone now dangles over the lobby of a skyscraper on 550 Madison Gabriella Angeleti 29 September 2021 Share Alicja Kwade, Solid Sky (2021). Photo: James Ewing (2021). Courtesy Gensler. Alicja Kwade will unveil a monumental permanent sculpture in New York early next year, titled Solid Sky (2021). The work follows the Polish-German artist’s acclaimed sculptural project ParaPivot (2019) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which engulfed the museum’s rooftop with a constellation of stone spheres installed on intersecting steel grids. The constellation, Kwade said, evoked the solar system. The commission, which has been produced for an undisclosed amount, is part of the revitalisation project of the Philip Johnson and John Burgee-designed corporate tower 550 Madison in Manhattan, whose previous tenants included AT&T and Sony Music. The 37-storey Midtown skyscraper was completed in 1984 and has been under renovation since 2016, after it was purchased by the Saudi investment firm Olayan Group. In 2018, it became designated a city landmark. The work comprises a nearly 22,000 kilogram polished spherical stone suspended from the ceiling of the glassbox lobby with stainless steel chains. It is made from a rare quartzite called Azul do Macaúbas that was quarried in northeastern Brazil (and only exists otherwise in few parts of Africa) and contains various intensities of blue delineated by white veins. “This rock is the result of a metamorphosis that took place over one billion years ago, and a metamorphosis always has something metaphysical and magical about it,” Kwade tells The Art Newspaper. “We cannot fathom such a period of time at all—it makes us feel small and unimportant and fills us with awe.” Kwade likens the work to planet Earth. “It appears very fragile and small, in comparison to the entirety of the universe,” Kwade says. “Here it hangs in chains, almost like a wrecking ball that is standing still, or like a warning. The surroundings of the work are rushing past while the rock stands still, representing the systems in which we live—that of capitalism—and reminding us where this system takes place: on one racing globe!” The Berlin-based artist has presented work in the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017 and the most recent edition of Desert X this year. In 2015, Kwade was commissioned by the Public Art Fund to create a work for the Doris C. Freedman Plaza in Central Park. She created a 19th-century style clock titled Against the Run (2015) that rotated backwards while showing the correct time, warping perceptions of time and space.\n Alicja Kwade Share \n", "label": [[0, 12, "ARTIST"], [19, 31, "ARTIST"], [50, 58, "GPE"], [174, 200, "ARTIST"], [201, 218, "DATE"], [225, 237, "ARTIST"], [239, 248, "WORK_OF_ART"], [250, 254, "DATE"], [264, 275, "ARTIST"], [277, 281, "DATE"], [302, 314, "ARTIST"], [363, 371, "GPE"], [396, 405, "WORK_OF_ART"], [407, 411, "DATE"], [487, 496, "WORK_OF_ART"], [498, 502, "DATE"], [511, 537, "MUSEUM"], [671, 676, "ARTIST"], [820, 834, "ARTIST"], [839, 850, "ARTIST"], [880, 887, "GPE"], [891, 900, "GPE"], [1005, 1009, "DATE"], [1046, 1050, "DATE"], [1121, 1125, "DATE"], [1403, 1409, "GPE"], [1694, 1699, "ARTIST"], [1835, 1840, "ARTIST"], [1958, 1963, "ARTIST"], [2277, 2283, "GPE"], [2323, 2343, "EVENT"], [2347, 2351, "DATE"], [2406, 2410, "DATE"], [2412, 2417, "ARTIST"], [2538, 2550, "DATE"], [2570, 2585, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2587, 2591, "DATE"], [2688, 2700, "ARTIST"]]}

Every year, a new work will be commissioned for the Foundation’s collections from a topically relevant contemporary artist. A curated exhibition will be organized in conjunction with the commission to shed further light on the artist’s current practice. Alicja Kwade tailored her exhibition to interact with EMMA’s unique architecture. The five installations all somehow portray motion and metamorphosis engaging in an intriguing dialogue with the museum’s interior spaces and surrounding scenery. Kwade drew inspiration to her new works from the concrete brutalism of EMMA’s architecture and the building’s history as a printing house, particularly the vision of heavy printing machines and giant rolls of paper that once filled the gallery spaces. The five sculptural installations in the exhibition undergo a gradual process of transformation, taking the visitor on a journey through time and space. Kwade’s works reflects on the interaction of people and nature, as well as on our relationship with the natural world as a broader philosophical question. Her art challenges our perceptions and understanding of the fundamental nature of reality. What makes things what they are—or could everything be totally different? Alicja Kwade\n Alicja Kwade (b. 1979 Katowice, Poland) lives and works in Berlin. She is an award-winning artist whose work has featured at the Venice Biennale and numerous major museums over the past decade. In addition to EMMA, Espoo her works are currently on show at Kunsthal Charlottenborg and at Louisiana Art Museum in Copenhagen, at Hayward Gallery in London and at König Gallery in Berlin. The exhibition is curated by Marie Nipper (Creator Projects) and EMMA’s Chief Curator Arja Miller.

It makes you think about the material world around us contemplating on emotions of creation and destruction. Worktable takes place in different rooms where the audience participates in the chain of events through different actions. The installation progresses according to a script created by Kate McIntosh in a rhythm set by the participants. Composed of everyday objects, the changing environment invites visitors one at a time inside the installation. Participants will receive instructions, tools and safety gear—we will hand you a hammer and you get to decide how to take things apart. The performative work has toured the world since 2011 and it has been realised in more than 30 venues to date. Worktable will be constructed in the exhibition space of EMMA in November. It will be open to the public for two weeks in collaboration with the international theatre festival Baltic Circle. Kate McIntosh\n New-Zealand-born Kate McIntosh (b. 1974) is a multidisciplinary artist residing in Brussels. She works with installations, performance and theatre. Her work focuses on the physicality of both the performer and the audience, the manipulation of materials and objects, and the relationships with and within the audience. McIntosh has a constant fascination with a sense of play with the audience, theatre imagery and twisted humour.

In 2019 she designed the Met rooftop garden, and now she has a major show in Berlin. Collectors worldwide are clamoring for her complex art. The price - almost irrelevant.  Watch video 26:02.\nContemporary art: still dominated by male \"geniuses,\" but things are changing. Women are becoming stronger and stronger and are increasingly attracting the interest of museums and the art market. Artist Alicja Kwade Right at the forefront is installation artist and sculptor Alicja Kwade. She is one of the most exciting and sought-after artists in the world, and her international career is reaching a new peak. In 2019, she transformed the rooftop of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and now Berlin is featuring her large showcase.  Exhibition Alicja Kwade, \"In Abwesenheit\" | \"In Absence\" in Berlinische Galerie, Museum of Modern Art In her exhibition \"In Absence\", the artist is at the very center for the first time: Her heartbeat can be heard live and the walls are papered with her own DNA. Outside, a \"specter\" keeps watch - a shrouded Alicja Kwade made of bronze. For Arts.21, she now opens the doors of her gigantic studio in Berlin and grants an exclusive look behind the scenes. Installation «Pars pro Toto» by Alicja Kwade  Alicja Kwade is not only an artist, but also the manager of an art factory: with meticulous production processes for her expansive works that must be managed and an enormous logistical apparatus to overcome. The question remains: Is all of her success on the international art market a curse or a blessing?.\nDate 09.10.2021.\nDuration 26:02 mins.\n Homepage Arts.21\n- The Cultural Magazine.\nAll videos Arts.21 , Arts.21 - The Cultural Magazine.\nKeywords Berlin Gallery , Alicja Kwade , Christian Boros , Johann König , Metropolitan Museum of Art , Karen Boros , Lisa Zeitz , Diversity United , Kamel Mennour , In Absence.\nSend us your feedback.

{"id": 156, "data": "AR-BEIT (2020) | Augmented Reality In the Autumn 2020, Acute Art produced AR-BEIT, a new augmented reality project in collaboration with Alicja Kwade. Free to download via the Acute Art app, this series consists of four individual sculptures, in reference to works from the artist’s oeuvre, developed within this new medium. Unlike their physical counterparts, users are able to touch, interact with and virtually place the works in and outdoors allowing users to engage with Kwade’s works within a new dimension. Kreisel (Inception) (AR) Inspired by The Interpretation of Dreams written by Sigmund Freud in 1899, Kreisel (Inception) (AR) emulates the small silvery spinning top seen in the last frame of Christopher Nolan’s 2010 film of the same name. Within the film, the spinning top is used to determine whether they are really ‘awake’ as the characters find themselves trapped in a dream within a dream. However, in Kwade’s work, the spinning top constantly spins, trapping her audience within the dream. Angst (AR) Referring to the popular proverb, ‘to bury one’s head in the sand’, Angst (AR), an anthropomorphised Kaiser-Idell lamp sticks its head into the ground when the user walks towards it. The sculpture’s curious mannerisms forces an emphatic reaction from the user. All at Any Time (AR) In All at Any Time (AR), users are able to drag hypothetical forms of the universe across the screen so they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, referring to the idea of interacting parallel universes. MarsMelone (AR) MarsMelone (AR) looks initially like a common watermelon, but on closer inspection, users will notice its stripes run horizontally instead of vertically, emulating the outer surface of mars. Much like the planet itself, the work hovers in space. Users are also able to rotate the object by tapping on it.  LinienLand (2019) | Augmented Reality Produced in collaboration with Acute Art, this immersive work consists of a gridded architecture approximately 36 feet in height, in which massive spheres rotate like planets in orbit. Alicia Kwade considers the structure as a possible multiverse in which each quadrant represents a parallel world within a mathematical, human-made linear system. Kwade’s AR sculpture presents the first immaterial development of the artist’s ongoing project LinienLand. This iteration moves the project towards a new perceptual experience of art in an increasingly information-based world. While the digital work is formally related to Kwade’s real-life sculptural installations such as LinienLand (2018) and ParaPivot (2019), the sense of wonderment engendered by the IRL works is displaced onto the illusionism afforded by AR technology and introduces motion as an additional element of the work. Viewed through an app, the work appears to be a substantial structure, but is in fact pure information rendered through complex sets of digital data.\n About Alicja Kwade Alicja Kwade (born 1979) lives and works in Berlin. Kwade’s work investigates and questions the structures of our reality and society and reflects on the perception of time in our everyday life. Her diverse practice is based around concepts of space, time, science and philosophy, takes shape in sculptural objects, video and photography.

In her sculptures, as well as installations, photographs, and films, Kwade occupies herself with the structural properties of everyday objects and questioning the veracity of matter, revealing possibilities for alternate realities, while examining social agreements and supposed truths. A rapidly rising international star in the art world, Kwade presented her first U.S. solo exhibition at 303 Gallery in New York in the spring of 2016 and has since opened several other international exhibitions, ReReason at Yuz Museum in Shanghai, and Linienland at Haus Konstruktiv in Zurich (open through May 6, 2018.) TunnelTeller, her new work for The Trustees, is Kwade’s first large-scale public artwork commission in the U.S. The installation opened to the public on Saturday, May 19, 2018, and will be on view through April 1, 2020 at Castle Hill on the Crane Estate in Ipswich. Working with independent curator Pedro Alonzo, the exclusive curator for the Trustees Art & the Landscape initiative since the program’s inception, Kwade’s new work is a site-specific piece that embodies the spirit of the place and interprets the natural and cultural surroundings with a nontraditional form of expression. Resting upon the outlines of the former hedge maze once located to the east of the Great House at Castle Hill, and overlooking Cape Ann and Crane Beach, the structure will draw upon the property’s gilded era majesty, the Crane family history, and the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape. One of The Trustees’ most iconic properties, the Crane Estate is comprised of 2,100 protected acres consisting of Castle Hill – a National Historic Landmark that includes the Crane mansion or “Great House” – the Inn at Castle Hill, Crane Beach, and the Crane Wildlife Refuge. The property was formerly owned by Chicago industrialist Richard T. Crane, Jr., who purchased the property in 1910 because he was captivated by the beauty of the landscape. Over many years, Crane worked with a dream team eight leading architects, landscape architects, and artists to shape his summer family retreat. In 1928, he crowned the estate with a grand mansion designed by renowned Chicago architect David Adler. The family generously bequeathed the majestic estate to The Trustees in 1940 to preserve for public use and enjoyment. Today, the Crane Estate welcomes over 350,000 visitors annually from near and far and offers year-round educational and cultural programs and activities. While the Crane family had a long history of working with designers and artists at Castle Hill, this is The Trustees’ first presentation of a commissioned contemporary work in this historic and majestic landscape of rolling hills and coastal views. Alonzo describes TunnelTeller as an immersive structure designed to challenge the viewer’s notions of space and perception. At a moment of tremendous diversity in the arts where virtually any material and combination of unique mediums are being used as a means of artistic expression, he describes Alicja Kwade as an artist who stands out for her ability to use raw materials and everyday objects to create bold works that imbue meaning, creativity, and surprising functionality. TunnelTeller will be free with admission to Castle Hill and open to the public when the property is open, from sunrise to sunset.

By exploring models and constructs that form our perception of time, space and matter, her large-scale installations question the possibilities of subjective and objective knowledge. For this show at the Berlinische Galerie, the artist begins by focusing on herself. ›In Abwesenheit‹ (In Absence) centres on recent works by Alicja Kwade that might in a broad sense be read as selfportraits. Kwade seeks ways to describe a person and their physical presence in space: with a heartbeat, an individual DNA code or a combination of chemical elements. With Kwade’s installation designed specifically for our first big exhibition hall, the Berlinische Galerie has added another work to its successful format of in-situ projects by contemporary artists working in Berlin. Kwade studied at Berlin’s University of the Arts from 1999 to 2005 and is now one of the most sought-after artists in the international arena. She has recently exhibited in, among other places, Tours, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Zurich, Barcelona, Shanghai, Reykjavik, Venice, New York and London.\n Duration: {{fromTo}} Location \n", "label": [[0, 12, "ARTIST"], [14, 27, "GPE"], [29, 33, "DATE"], [59, 72, "GALLERY"], [74, 80, "GPE"], [82, 88, "GPE"], [90, 95, "GPE"], [117, 127, "ARTIST"], [128, 140, "ARTIST"], [203, 207, "DATE"], [242, 248, "GPE"], [250, 254, "DATE"], [268, 281, "GALLERY"], [283, 289, "GPE"], [291, 297, "GPE"], [299, 304, "GPE"], [326, 336, "ARTIST"], [337, 349, "ARTIST"], [379, 390, "WORK_OF_ART"], [392, 396, "DATE"], [434, 443, "GPE"], [445, 449, "DATE"], [481, 491, "ARTIST"], [492, 504, "ARTIST"], [506, 516, "WORK_OF_ART"], [526, 530, "DATE"], [556, 569, "GALLERY"], [571, 577, "GPE"], [579, 585, "GPE"], [587, 592, "GPE"], [614, 624, "ARTIST"], [681, 693, "ARTIST"], [694, 708, "EVENT"], [710, 720, "EVENT"], [1119, 1138, "GALLERY"], [1190, 1196, "GPE"], [1404, 1410, "MONEY"], [1509, 1514, "MONEY"], [1743, 1762, "GALLERY"], [2231, 2250, "GALLERY"], [2635, 2647, "ARTIST"], [2650, 2654, "DATE"], [2923, 2942, "GALLERY"], [2987, 3001, "EVENT"], [3004, 3014, "EVENT"], [3043, 3055, "ARTIST"], [3110, 3115, "ARTIST"], [3271, 3276, "ARTIST"], [3353, 3372, "GALLERY"], [3476, 3482, "GPE"], [3484, 3489, "ARTIST"], [3538, 3550, "DATE"], [3685, 3693, "GPE"], [3695, 3705, "GPE"], [3707, 3713, "GPE"], [3715, 3724, "GPE"], [3726, 3734, "GPE"], [3736, 3745, "GPE"], [3747, 3753, "GPE"], [3755, 3763, "GPE"], [3768, 3774, "GPE"]]}
{"id": 165, "data": "Born in 1979 in Katowice (Poland), Alicja Kwade lives and works in Berlin (Germany). Alicja Kwade’s work investigates and questions the structures of our reality and society and reflects on the perception of time in our everyday life. Her diverse practice is based around concepts of space, time, science and philosophy, takes shape in sculptural objects, video and even photography. By Dimitris Lempesis\n Photo: Pace & KÖNIG Galleries Archive Alicja Kwade presents her first solo show in Seoul with a double exhibition “Sometimes I Prefer To Sit On A Chair On The Earth” at KÖNIG Gallery and “Surrounded By Universes” at pace Gallery, showing more than thirty of her latest works. Alicja Kwade’s new series, “ENTROPIE” reconstructs this process in snapshots. Like many of her works, “ENTROPIE”  questions our very modes of perception. Its representations reveal that the apparent order was actually already in a state of entropy from the beginning – ‘entropy’ being the physical measure of disorder or, more accurately, the absence of orde’. In the series, watch hands on paper represent the arrangement of the molecules. At any other point in time, these could also be arranged differently, as micro-conditions occur in almost infinite possible variations. Yet still randomness does not prevail. Far more, each work is located in a clearly stated point in time. The entropy steadily increases, imposing its direction on time. The same toposes of the contingency, conditionality and contractedness of our perceptions also appear in other works in this exhibition. Realities run in parallel, states are unstable, and arbitrary settlements often determine our experience of the world. This is perhaps most clearly expressed in works such as “EIN JAHR” (2023) or “EIN MONAT” (July 2020), where the number of hours in the stated period is visualized by a sequence of watch hands. For the observer, discovering a signified amid the forest of hands is nigh-on impossible; instead, their attention is inexorably drawn to the countless signifiers and ultimately to the unit of time measurement itself. In these unfurled moments, time seems to stand still, and the repetitive, rhythmic waves of the watch hands show just how arbitrary and coincidental the division of time into hours and minutes ultimately is, and how starkly this settlement determines our experience of reality. The works on show in Seoul share a common recurring motif: circular movements. These are also central to Kwade’s sculptural works. “DUODECUPLE BE-HIDE”, for example, consists of twelve stones in a circular arrangement separated from each other by double-sided mirrors. Though identical in shape, they are made of different materials, such as granite, marble and erased. For the full effect of the sculpture to unfold, the observer must walk around it. Depending on the observer’s position, the mirrors appear as either a reflective or a transparent surface, confronting each stone with a doppelgänger. Different viewing angles produce different versions of reality and open up parallel worlds which show the same object in different states: doubled, halved or deleted. Kwade uses these shifts in perspective to touch on existential questions around the location of a subject within a space. Here, too, time and movement are linked: the fact that the arrangement of the twelve stones is reminiscent of a clock is no coincidence. Ultimately, the works on show in the exhibitions are tools by which to explore our own sensory perceptions. They open up cracks through which we feel we can sense anew the conditionality of the world around us and our place within it. But the cracks also reveal to us the limits of our perceptions: whatever we do, we will always be a part of the system we are trying to observe. Given this realisation, it would be easy to fall into nihilism – but we can also choose to carry on trying. In “SIÈGE DU MONDE”, Kwade insinuates with a touch of humor that we may well dream of sitting on the globe and thinking about the universe. The chair in this piece seems to have been wedged over an earthy red rock and might also offer a vantage point from which to view the sculpture “ALL AT ANY TIME”. This comprises nine ceramic objects painted in shiny black and shaped like intertwining chess pieces. Though completely immobile, they appear to rotate and influence each other. The body of one determines the shape and movement of the next in a complex system of interdependencies. “ALL AT ANY TIME” references various theories on the history of the universe, from the Big Bang to the present day, and with it the exhibition comes full circle: we find ourselves exploring the hypothesis proposed at the start, which states that as we move into the future, entropy will inevitably increase.

{"id": 167, "data": "'; Bio Alicja Kwade was born in 1979 in Katowice, Poland, and lives and works in Berlin. Her installations play and work with the mental perception of objects, space, time, repetitions and the physical experience of the body in space. Read More... In 2005, she graduated in Sculpture at the Universität der Künste in Berlin. Starting with common materials, such as glass, copper, bicycles and metal tubes, the artist shapes each object to create new meanings and connections related to space and time. Every proposal creates in the viewer a sense of disorientation, questions and thoughts on topics that enter the realms of astrophysics and philosophy. In Hypothetisches Gebilde (2015), Kwade draws inspiration from space-time wormholes to involve the universe, visible and invisible, the connection of parallel worlds and the movement of shapes of different sizes and states of being, all this is shown by Kwade through a stone positioned in different angles in a sculpture composed of copper pipes. Overlaying common concepts, the artist recreates different levels of reality and creates a complex installation connected to themes of the absurd, ironic and magical, and matter. Her works are in major international institutions, including TRAFO Centre for Contemporary Art, Szczecin; Public Art Fund, New York; Kunsthalle Mannheim; Arsenals Exhibition Hall, Riga; and the Contemporary Jewish Museum, San Francisco.

The exhibition at the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein will position the artist in the larger context of his oeuvre. Legno e ferro (Wood and Iron), 1967, from the museum's own Arte Povera collection forms the exhibition's point of departure, accentuated by the two famous works Niente da vedere, niente da nascondere (Nothing to see, nothing to conceal), 1969–86, and Tutto (Everything), 1987: the emptiness of the one masks the greatest abundance conceivable; detail disappears in the complexity of the other. Boetti's artistic approach is often ambiguous and playful. His unconstrained handling of letters, words and numbers gives rise to a new understanding of things – play as a thought experiment. The exhibition is being mounted in cooperation with Cordula von Keller, Rome, and with the kind support of Rinaldo Rossi, Genoa. The Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther König is publishing an edition of the 81- part work Insicuro Noncurante, 1975, to mark the occasion. During the exhibition the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein will publish an additional documentation.\n More pictures to this exhibition Exhibition view Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, Photo: Stefan Altenburger Photography, Zürich © Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein Exhibition view Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, Photo: Stefan Altenburger Photography, Zürich © Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein Exhibition view Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, Photo: Stefan Altenburger Photography, Zürich © Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein.\nOpening Thu, 20.1.2005 18.00.\nGuided tours Thu, 27.1.2005 18.00.\nThu 20.1.

Photo: Marco Anelli. Magazzino Italian Art, Cold Spring, New York\n 2 October 2020 – 11 January 2021 by LILLY WEI Bochner Boetti Fontana, the elegant exhibition on view until 11 January 2021, is installed in one of Magazzino Italian Art’s equally elegant galleries, recently reopened. Located in Cold Spring in the Hudson River valley, now ablaze with autumnal colour, it is well worth the 90-minute drive from New York City, offering a serene time-out zone during the ongoing pandemic. If you are concerned about safety, so is the museum, which adheres stringently to coronavirus guidelines, including advance appointments, very few visitors at a time, temperature checks and a gizmo to be worn that flashes red when the social distance rule is breached. Bochner Boetti Fontana, installation view, Magazzino Italian Art 2 October – 11 January 2020. Photo: Alexa Hoyer. Courtesy of Magazzino Italian Art. Founded in 2017 by collectors Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu, it is dedicated to Italian postwar and contemporary art and, as another incentive to visit, there is an excellent, ongoing exhibition of the big guns of arte povera (Alighiero Boetti, Jannis Kounellis, Mario Merz, Marisa Merz, Giuseppe Penone, Michelangelo Pistoletto, and more from the collection), occupying the several other generously scaled, skylighted rooms of the spare, high-ceilinged 20,000 square foot centre designed by the architect Miguel Quismondo. Magazzino Italian Art, Cold Spring, New York, exterior view. Photo: Marco Anelli. The pioneering American conceptualist Mel Bochner, the curator of the show, noted that the history of his engagement with Italian art began nearly a decade before he went to Italy. He amusingly recounted his introduction as a student to Lucio Fontana’s work at the Carnegie International Exhibition of 1961. Seeing the slash in the canvas, horrified that someone had vandalised the painting, he immediately alerted the security guard. A few years later, after seeing Italian fresco paintings at a blockbuster exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he became enamoured of trecento and quattrocento painters and was inspired by them to work directly on to the wall. Bochner Boetti Fontana, installation view, Magazzino Italian Art 2 October – 11 January 2020. Photo: Alexa Hoyer. Courtesy of Magazzino Italian Art. But it was not until 1969, when he was included in the landmark post-minimalist exhibition When Attitude Becomes Form, in Berne, curated by Harald Szeemann, that he saw in greater depth what contemporary European artists, among them Boetti, were making. Their thinking mirrored his own, the emphasis on process, seriality, the use of commonplace, ephemeral materials, text, mathematics, photographic documentation and, often and perhaps most divergent from American minimalism and conceptualism, a sense of play that sparred with the serious. The following year, Bochner was given a solo show at the Galleria Sperone in Turin, the first of many in Italy in what would become a mutual admiration society. There, he met Boetti for the first time. Bochner Boetti Fontana, installation view, Magazzino Italian Art 2 October – 11 January 2020. Photo: Alexa Hoyer. Courtesy of Magazzino Italian Art. Of the 18 works in the show, the earliest is a Concetto Spaziale on black velvet by Fontana from 1956, the year of his first buchi (holes) paintings, constellated with tiny punctures and a cluster of coloured glass shards, launching his lifelong investigations into space, colour, sound and movement as a function of time. Bochner Boetti Fontana, installation view, Magazzino Italian Art 2 October – 11 January 2020. Photo: Alexa Hoyer. Courtesy of Magazzino Italian Art. A more iconic Fontana is the Concetto Spaziale, Attese (1959), a stunning burnt orange square with three curved slashes. And his nine-part Concetto Spaziale, Quanta (1960) is given marquee status on the freestanding wall at the entrance to the gallery. Lucio Fontana, Concetto Spaziale, Quanta, 1960. Bochner Boetti Fontana, installation view, Magazzino Italian Art 2 October – 11 January 2020. Photo: Alexa Hoyer. Courtesy of Magazzino Italian Art. That honour is qualified by what seems a curious lapse of scrupulousness in an otherwise scrupulous installation: the placement of the title of the show just above it. Nonetheless, Quanta, painted a vivid red, holds its own, the small, mostly irregular, slashed and holed geometric shapes are juxtaposed into a kind of force field that might not be state-of-the-art technology, but nonetheless emit their own potent phenomenological charge. Boetti was considered an exemplary arte povera artist, but then veered off towards more unorthodox enterprises based on presciently idiosyncratic collaborations (notably, even with himself for a time as Alighiero e Boetti), as well as delving into questions about artistic identity, authorship and doubling. His obsessive interest in systems and patterns, wordplay, alphabet and number games, and in mathematical calculations, shared by Bochner, is concisely presented in six works. Among them is Da mille a mille (1975), consisting of 11 sheets of graph paper, each with 1,000 squares – the number 1 and 0 of metaphoric and mathematic significance, done in black ballpoint pen, a medium he used handily in his Biro drawings. Alighiero Boëtti, Teresa Giancarlo Carlotta Beatrice, 1977. Bochner Boetti Fontana, installation view, Magazzino Italian Art 2 October – 11 January 2020. Photo: Alexa Hoyer. Courtesy of Magazzino Italian Art. Another ambitious example here is Teresa Giancarlo Carlotta Beatrice (1977) in blue ballpoint ink, measuring nearly 10 feet across. As in other works of his, he invented the game and the rules, but allowed his collaborators the freedom to make their own choices within the given parameters. He was also fascinated by the accidental and the greater world, travelling to Afghanistan and Pakistan, among several lesser-visited countries before globetrotting artists became the norm, and incorporating other cultures into his work. Among his favoured places was Kabul where he worked with local craftswomen, commissioning them to embroider his sumptuous Arrazzi (tapetries) series. Alternandosi e dividendosi (1989), in full colour, made in collaboration with a Sufi master from Peshawar and the Afghan weavers, combines Italian and Farsi, the title referring to order and disorder, another instance of mixing letters, words and numbers in ways that initially seem rational, but collapse into a wilful subjectivity.

Bochner is represented by eight works, among them the striking Measurement: 12 inches Between (1999) from his well-known Measurement series. Counting also figures prominently in his repertoire, represented here by Counting: 24 Trajectories (1997) and other recognisable works anchored in mathematical calculations and systems, in direct dialogue with Boetti, and in a more subtle exchange with Fontana. Mel Bochner, Blah Blah Blah, 2009. Bochner Boetti Fontana, installation view, Magazzino Italian Art 2 October – 11 January 2020. Photo: Alexa Hoyer. Courtesy of Magazzino Italian Art. Bochner’s word paintings on velvet, the mocking, Blah Blah Blah (2009) and Complain (2007), from his Thesaurus series, the title a verb to parallel the pictorial activism of the text, and the wall painting, Language Is Not Transparent (1970/2019) remain bracing, arcing between sensuous painterly image, the lexical and their subversion and siphoning.

But it is the sotto voce connective threads that are the most appealing – and for a conceptual show, it is remarkably lush, even glamorous. For instance, Bochner’s floor installation Meditation on the Theorem of Pythagoras (1972/1993) has never looked better, the sparkling nuggets of jewel-like Murano glass arranged in a diagram of the foundational mathematical equation (a2 + b2 = c2) would not be out of place in a Bulgari window display. And the link is the source of the glass, from Fontana’s studio. In turn, the glass chunks are connected to those in Fontana’s Concetto Spaziale, its plush black velvet ground making us re-evaluate velvet and the velvet support of Bochner’s word paintings. In turn, we are reminded of Boetti’s embroidered Tavola Pitagorica (1990), the title evoking the Greek philosopher yet again. And once there, we see that Blah Blah Blah, with all its ambiguities, is strategically placed beneath it. And don’t forget to look for Fontana’s text piece scrawled on paper, a quintessential arte povera tease, or a harbinger of today’s constant spin. Mel Bochner, Yiskor (For the Jews of Rome), 1993.

Then there is Bochner’s other floor piece, the poignant Yiskor (For the Jews of Rome) (1993), consisting of burnt matchsticks arranged in the shape of a Jewish star on a US army blanket to signify the liberation of Rome in 1944 by the Allies. The word yizkor means to remember, as well as signifying a memorial service in Yiddish, a language that appears time and again in his work, sounding an autobiographical note that is coincident with today’s more personalised culture.

The opening was memorable not for the art within, but the action outside. To enter the exhibition the great and the good of the New York art world had to pass a picket line of about 500 feminist protesters, many of them carrying banners that read: \"Where Is Ana Mendieta?\" That question was directed at the male-dominated art establishment, which feminists claimed had already forgotten Ana Mendieta, who had died seven years earlier. What incensed the protesters even more was the inclusion in the show of a work by her former partner, the minimalist sculptor Carl Andre. To them, as well as to Mendieta's family and many of her friends, Andre was responsible for her death. In the early hours of 8 September 1985, Mendieta had – to borrow the words Andre had used when he called the emergency services – \"somehow gone out the window\" of their 34th floor apartment on Manhattan's Mercer Street. Both had been drinking heavily. Andre later claimed to remember nothing of the events leading up to her death and that she may even have committed suicide, but those that knew her well – and knew of her acute fear of heights – thought this unlikely. Many of them believed he had pushed or even thrown her out of the window during a drunken argument. \"What happened that night, no one will ever know,\" says the artist Ted Victoria, a close friend of Mendieta who still lives and works in a studio in SoHo close to where she first lived after arriving in New York. \"But the notion that she would jump out the window in her underwear – no. She had too much going for her at the time, more so than him. Her work was being noticed. And she wasn't depressed. \"I know because I saw her a few nights before her death. She was up and happy. She hated heights, so she would not have climbed up on the window, which was close to, and just above, the bed in their apartment. My guess is they were fighting and it just happened, this terrible thing.\" \"Most people thought he had done something active,\" says Dotty Attie, an artist and friend of Mendieta from when they both belonged to the all-women AIR gallery in New York in the early 1980s. \"Others, who knew him, could not believe it. Most of his women friends supported him, but people wanted to blame somebody. There was a lot of division in the New York art world over her death. People took sides.\" When the police arrived, they found the couple's bedroom in a mess and Andre with scratch marks on his nose and arms. His initial statements differed from his recorded message to the emergency services. He was arrested and later charged with murder. In court, a doorman testified that he heard a woman screaming \"No\" several times around 5.30am, and then the thud of her body as it hit the roof of the all-night delicatessen below. After three separate indictments, Andre was acquitted on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he had pushed her during a drunken row. Many of her friends remain unconvinced of his innocence. They cite contradictions in his police interviews, and his decision to be tried by a judge rather than a jury – which meant that the evidence was weighed up without him being cross-examined by the prosecution. \"There were too many things that were just not right about the trial,\" says the feminist writer and academic B Ruby Rich, a friend and staunch supporter of Mendieta, who wrote a long, critical article in the Village Voice newspaper following the failure of the first indictment. \"Not least the cynical way in which his lawyers tried to use her art to back up the suggestion that she committed suicide. Many powerful figures in the New York art world colluded in that.\" Until recently, the question asked by those feminist protesters might have been amended to \"Who is Ana Mendieta?\", so unknown was her art outside the rarefied world of feminist art criticism. But, as the recent big show of her work at the Whitney Museum in New York and the imminent retrospective at the Hayward gallery in London attests, Mendieta is undergoing a reappraisal as a pioneering artist whose work, as the Hayward's artistic director, Ralph Rugoff, notes \"ranged nomadically across practices associated with body art, land art, performance, sculpture, photography and film\". Cuban-born and American-raised, Mendieta described her work as \"earth-body\" art. From 1971, when she had her first solo show while an MA student at the University of Iowa, until her death, she created a diverse collection of work that included silhouettes of her body created in mud, earth, rocks, wild flowers and leaves, performance pieces that evoked the folk and occult traditions of her native Cuba as well as her beloved Mexico and subversive self-portraits that played with notions of beauty, belonging and gender. In her performance pieces, where she sometimes used blood \"as a very, powerful magical thing\", she evoked the power of female sexuality as well as the horror of male sexual violence. In her photographic self-portraits, she pressed her face against glass to distort her features or pictured herself dripping in blood or disguised as a man with glued-on facial hair. Mendieta's art, like her spirit, was fuelled by a restlessness rooted in her exile from Cuba. Friends described her variously as \"sparky\", \"provocative\", \"tempestuous\", \"outspoken\" and \"fiercely ambitious.\" After her death, many saw, in her often dark and ritualistic art, a foreshadowing of her fate – she once staged a performance in which visitors came upon her prone under a blood-splattered white sheet. Others claimed her as the freest of female free spirits in a male-dominated art world. The curator and scholar Irit Rogoff, her as \"essentialised through an association of wild appetites and with unbounded female sexuality.\" It is only now that the power of her art is finally taking precedence over the stereotypes that were thrust upon her and the darkly dramatic manner of her death. Mendieta was born in November 1948, the second of three children to Ignacio and Raquel Mendieta, a well-off, upper-middle-class couple. Her father, a supporter of Fidel Castro, was made an assistant in the post-revolutionary ministry of state in 1959 but, disillusioned with the anti-Catholicism of the new Cuba, later became involved in organising counter-revolutionary activities. As did his two daughters, Ana and Raquelin, aged 12 and 14. Fearing for their safety, he arranged for their passage to America, in 1961 through Operation Pedro Pan, a scheme organised by a priest in Miami that allowed around 14,000 children to leave the country and enter the US under the guardianship of the Catholic church. \"For Ana, it was an adventurous thing,\" her sister Raquelin later remembered, \"When we arrived in Miami, she kissed the ground.\" Her euphoria was short-lived. After a time in which they were given over to the care of an Iowa reform school, where beatings and confinement were common punishments for the slightest misdemeanour, the sisters were separated and spent several years being shunted from one foster home to another. Ana felt abandoned by her family and isolated from her homeland. She did not see her mother and brother again until 1966, or her father, who was jailed for disloyalty to Castro, until 1979. He died soon after arriving in America. \"You have to understand she came to America with nothing,\" says Victoria. \"That sense of exile was something she carried with her as well as a fierce independence of spirit. She would talk about it sometimes when she'd had a few drinks. I mean, coming from the heat and fire of Cuba to puritan Iowa would leave its mark on anyone and she had that survivor's spirit. \"She was driven in everything she did and that made her feisty and combative as well as great and generous company.\" Mendieta began making art at the University of Iowa, where she had a decade-long affair with the artist and academic Hans Breder, perhaps her most important formative influence. It was Breder who drew her attention to the notion of cross-disciplinary practice, citing the likes of Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein and the Viennese actionists as creative touchstones as well as organising visits by contemporary avant garde artists such as Hans Haacke and Vito Acconci. In the summer of 1971, Mendieta travelled to Mexico for research, describing the experience as \"like going back to the source, being able to get some magic just by being there.\" Her vision – of a unified art of the self, drawing on nature and place as well as performance and sculpture – was being formed. Its first manifestation was also one of the rawest: a series of visceral performances created in response to the 1973 rape and murder of a university student, Sara Ann Otten. By 1974, Mendieta was working on a series of performances that used blood as the primary material, including Body Tracks, in which she dips her hands and forearms in blood then smears them down a wall. Everything she did was documented on film or photographs, often by Breder. In the summer of 1975, having returned to Mexico, she created the first of her Siluetas series in which she left an imprint of her body in the ground. Her silhouette pieces became a kind of signature, and were often executed in stones, leaves and twigs, flowers and driftwood, and sometimes set on fire, outlined by fireworks or drenched with red paint. \"My art is grounded on the belief in one universal energy which runs though everything,\" she wrote in an artist's statement from the early 1980s, \"from insect to man, from man to spectre, from spectre to plant, from plant to galaxy.\" Rich, though, insists that Mendieta's art is as much rooted in the feminism of the time as any art tradition. \"She came out of the feminist movement as much as Cuba. In the 1970s, blood was being reclaimed as a feminine – and a feminist – material in art. Plus her early earth works, particularly those made in Mexico, are very potent because they are made by a woman. \"People place her in the earth works tradition of Robert Smithson or Richard Long, but when a woman engages with the earth it is a very different statement. Her body was her art and she placed it in the ground. In doing so, she was trying to ground herself in the earth but also reconnect with the earth that she was standing on even if it was not Cuba.\" Mendieta arrived in New York in 1978. She found a tiny apartment on Sullivan Street and eventually made friends with some of the leading feminist artists of the time, including Nancy Spero, Mary Beth Edelson and Carolee Schneemann. When Edelson organised a fancy-dress party for Louise Bourgeois, Mendieta went as Frida Kahlo. In 1979, also with Edelson's support, she joined the AIR all-women gallery on Wooster Street. \"We didn't have a unifying agenda or way of thinking,\" says Attie, a founding member, \"except that we wanted everything that men had in the art world. For most of us, that meant recognition.\" It was through Spero that Mendieta met Andre. Their relationship intrigued some of their friends and baffled others: she was feisty and opinionated, small and sexy; he came across as cold and detached, his towering presence as formidable as his intellectual aloofness. \"Carl and Ana were very different personalities and that is what attracted them to each other,\" says the Argentinian artist Liliana Porter, a friend of Mendieta. \"Carl was very methodical in his daily life, following routines, and Ana was the opposite. He liked her strong personality, her looks and her intensity and she enjoyed his company and in some way needed a more mature and steady point of re ference.\" Creatively, though, their art practices could not have been further apart: hers was wide-ranging, elemental and ritualistic; he was a minimalist whose work was refined and cerebral.(Andre is still best known in Britain for his infamous arrangement of 120 bricks at the Tate.) It is one of the ironies of her early death that her star was in the ascendancy as he was entering a period in which demand for his work fell and prices dipped accordingly. Often, when drink had been taken, she would taunt him about this, once saying, \"You know, Carl, minimalism is over… you already did your thing.\" He would respond in kind. \"They drank a lot,\" remembers Victoria. \"They would arrive around here for dinner with four or five bottles of champagne. There were arguments, mostly started by Ana. She was combative. She could bring out stuff that would really piss you off. That was just how she was when she was drunk. She had loads of attitude.\" Attie concurs: \"I had dinner with her and Carl in Rome and they both got very drunk. I remember her saying, 'Oh, he likes your work, but he's never bought anything.' It was mischievous and pointed and they went to it arguing. \"But I didn't get the feeling he was ever violent. I remember she wanted to drive home and it was he who said no. He had self-control even when he was very drunk. I had a hard time thinking he would push her.\" Mendieta moved to Rome in 1983 on a prestigious American Academy residency and fell in love with the city, describing it to friends as a cross between Cuba and New York. \"She felt accepted there in a way she never was in America,\" says Rich. \"She could be herself.\" For a while, her relationship with Andre hit the rocks, then, surprising everyone who knew them, they reunited and married in a private ceremony in Rome in January 1985. On her return to New York in August, though, she told friends she suspected him of having an affair in Berlin, where he had been working off and on. On Thursday 5 September 1985, the couple had dinner with Spero and her husband, the painter Leon Golub. Spero later described them as \"happy and relaxed\". Three nights later, they stayed in to have a Chinese takeaway, watch a movie and drink champagne. The following day, she was found dead on the roof of the delicatessen, 33 floors below an open window of their apartment, her body having hit the surface so hard that her head left an imprint. Even her death echoed her art. \"Ana was on her way somewhere else creatively when she was killed,\" says Rich, pointedly. \"She was starting to make objects rather than ephemeral works. Stuff she could sell. She was excited and optimistic.\" Attie recalls meeting her in Rome earlier in the year and feeling the same. \"She told me that she was making new work and that she was going to give up drinking and smoking because women artists did not get recognition until they were old. She said that she wanted to live long enough to savour it.\" Ana Mendieta: Traces is at the Hayward gallery, London, from Tuesday to 15 December. southbankcentre.co.uk, 0844 875 0073.\nTopics Art The Observer.\nFeminism Women features.\nReuse this content \n", "label": [[58, 70, "ARTIST"], [145, 157, "ARTIST"], [196, 204, "GPE"], [218, 222, "DATE"], [306, 318, "ARTIST"], [339, 368, "WORK_OF_ART"], [370, 374, "DATE"], [379, 391, "ARTIST"], [419, 431, "ARTIST"], [442, 456, "GALLERY"], [458, 466, "GPE"], [486, 515, "WORK_OF_ART"], [517, 521, "DATE"], [526, 538, "ARTIST"], [566, 578, "ARTIST"], [589, 603, "GALLERY"], [605, 613, "GPE"], [615, 631, "ARTIST"], [632, 643, "DATE"], [658, 662, "DATE"], [668, 685, "MUSEUM"], [689, 697, "GPE"], [804, 808, "GPE"], [938, 946, "GPE"], [1068, 1080, "ARTIST"], [1197, 1209, "ARTIST"], [1371, 1381, "ARTIST"], [1406, 1414, "ARTIST"], [1449, 1454, "ARTIST"], [1508, 1524, "DATE"], [1526, 1534, "ARTIST"], [1561, 1566, "ARTIST"], [1679, 1688, "GPE"], [1738, 1743, "ARTIST"], [2123, 2135, "ARTIST"], [2155, 2163, "ARTIST"], [2205, 2209, "GPE"], [2259, 2267, "GPE"], [2801, 2812, "ARTIST"], [2838, 2846, "ARTIST"], [2893, 2904, "GALLERY"], [2908, 2916, "GPE"], [2930, 2935, "DATE"], [3095, 3103, "GPE"], [3221, 3226, "ARTIST"], [3616, 3621, "ARTIST"], [4118, 4129, "ARTIST"], [4165, 4173, "ARTIST"], [4440, 4448, "GPE"], [4577, 4589, "ARTIST"], [4717, 4731, "MUSEUM"], [4735, 4743, "GPE"], [4782, 4797, "GALLERY"], [4801, 4807, "GPE"], [4817, 4825, "ARTIST"], [4896, 4903, "GALLERY"], [4925, 4937, "ARTIST"], [5097, 5105, "ARTIST"], [5151, 5155, "DATE"], [5464, 5468, "GPE"], [5492, 5498, "GPE"], [5952, 5960, "ARTIST"], [6040, 6044, "GPE"], [6472, 6483, "CURATOR"], [6748, 6756, "ARTIST"], [6769, 6782, "DATE"], [6994, 6998, "DATE"], [7055, 7059, "GPE"], [7250, 7257, "GPE"], [7262, 7266, "DATE"], [7330, 7335, "GPE"], [7403, 7409, "GPE"], [7462, 7465, "ARTIST"], [7555, 7560, "GPE"], [7882, 7885, "ARTIST"], [7998, 8002, "DATE"], [8066, 8070, "DATE"], [8103, 8110, "GPE"], [8148, 8155, "GPE"], [8176, 8184, "ARTIST"], [8390, 8394, "GPE"], [8595, 8603, "ARTIST"], [8712, 8723, "ARTIST"], [8780, 8786, "ARTIST"], [8876, 8890, "ARTIST"], [8892, 8902, "ARTIST"], [9028, 9039, "ARTIST"], [9044, 9056, "ARTIST"], [9075, 9079, "DATE"], [9081, 9089, "ARTIST"], [9103, 9109, "ARTIST"], [9477, 9481, "DATE"], [9542, 9546, "DATE"], [9548, 9556, "ARTIST"], [9648, 9659, "WORK_OF_ART"], [9808, 9814, "ARTIST"], [9833, 9837, "DATE"], [9858, 9864, "GPE"], [9895, 9903, "WORK_OF_ART"], [9971, 9981, "WORK_OF_ART"], [10309, 10314, "DATE"], [10404, 10408, "ARTIST"], [10431, 10439, "ARTIST"], [10564, 10568, "GPE"], [10577, 10582, "DATE"], [10715, 10721, "GPE"], [10823, 10838, "ARTIST"], [10842, 10854, "ARTIST"], [11121, 11125, "GPE"], [11128, 11136, "ARTIST"], [11148, 11156, "GPE"], [11160, 11164, "DATE"], [11196, 11211, "GPE"], [11305, 11316, "ARTIST"], [11318, 11335, "ARTIST"], [11340, 11358, "ARTIST"], [11365, 11372, "ARTIST"], [11407, 11423, "ARTIST"], [11425, 11433, "ARTIST"], [11442, 11453, "ARTIST"], [11458, 11462, "DATE"], [11474, 11481, "ARTIST"], [11508, 11511, "GALLERY"], [11533, 11547, "GPE"], [11609, 11614, "ARTIST"], [11756, 11761, "ARTIST"], [11767, 11775, "ARTIST"], [11780, 11785, "ARTIST"], [12011, 12015, "ARTIST"], [12020, 12023, "ARTIST"], [12134, 12148, "ARTIST"], [12162, 12170, "ARTIST"], [12173, 12177, "ARTIST"], [12241, 12244, "ARTIST"], [12604, 12609, "ARTIST"], [12633, 12640, "GPE"], [12691, 12695, "GALLERY"], [12961, 12965, "ARTIST"], [13072, 13080, "ARTIST"], [13204, 13207, "ARTIST"], [13360, 13365, "ARTIST"], [13402, 13406, "ARTIST"], [13410, 13414, "GPE"], [13796, 13804, "ARTIST"], [13814, 13818, "GPE"], [13822, 13826, "DATE"], [13947, 13951, "GPE"], [13956, 13964, "GPE"], [14017, 14024, "GPE"], [14032, 14036, "ARTIST"], [14097, 14102, "ARTIST"], [14210, 14214, "GPE"], [14218, 14230, "DATE"], [14249, 14257, "GPE"], [14261, 14267, "DATE"], [14335, 14341, "GPE"], [14393, 14409, "DATE"], [14438, 14443, "ARTIST"], [14473, 14483, "ARTIST"], [14485, 14490, "ARTIST"], [14859, 14862, "ARTIST"], [14931, 14935, "ARTIST"], [15066, 15071, "ARTIST"], [15095, 15099, "GPE"], [15366, 15378, "ARTIST"], [15380, 15386, "EVENT"], [15397, 15412, "GALLERY"], [15414, 15420, "GPE"], [15427, 15449, "DATE"]]}
{"id": 184, "data": "Viewing Room Main Site.\nSkip to content In a brief yet prolific career, the Cuban-born artist Ana Mendieta® created groundbreaking work in photography, film, video, drawing, sculpture, and site-specific installations. Amongst the major themes in her work are exile, displacement, and a return to the landscape, which remain profoundly relevant today. Her unique hybrid of form and documentation, works that she titled “siluetas,” are fugitive and potent traces of the artist’s inscription of her body in the landscape, often transformed by natural elements such as fire and water.\n The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, in collaboration with Galerie Lelong & Co., recently catalogued and digitized the entirety of Mendieta’s moving image works, discovering that the artist remarkably made more than 100 in the ten-year period in which she worked in the medium. The groundbreaking exhibition of her moving image works, Covered in Time and History: The Films of Ana Mendieta, was organized by the Katherine E. Nash Gallery, University of Minnesota in 2014, and has since travelled to several institutions worldwide, including NSU Art Museum Fort Lauderdale, Florida; University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive; Bildmuseet, Umeå, Sweden; Martin Gropius Bau, Berlin; and the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, Paris. Mendieta’s work has been the subject of six major museum retrospectives, the most recent of which, Ana Mendieta: Traces, was organized by the Hayward Gallery, England, in 2013, and travelled to the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, Austria, and the Galerie Rudolfinum, Czech Republic. Ana Mendieta: Earth Body, Sculpture and Performance 1972–1985 was organized by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., in 2005 and travelled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Des Moines Art Center, Iowa; and Miami Art Museum, Florida.\n Mendieta was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1948, and died in New York City in 1985.

{"id": 185, "data": "Skip to main content Ana Mendieta See all works by Ana Mendieta.\nBorn in Havana in 1948, Ana Mendieta came to the United States after being exiled from Cuba in 1961. Mendieta studied with Hans Breder (b. 1935) at the University of Iowa, Iowa City (BA 1969, MA 1972, MFA 1977). Although she worked at times in Cuba, Mexico, and Italy, her primary residence was in New York from 1978 until her death in 1985. Mendieta is best known for what she called \"earth-body works,\" and her practice centered on themes of the female body, death, cultural displacement, and transformation. While her oeuvre may be seen as autobiographical, the use of overlapping forms between landscape and the body in her film, video, and photographic work is aligned also with land art and allowed her work to transgress the bounds of personal experience to convey universal modes of being. Having moved to the United States at a young age, Mendieta had an interest in Cuban culture and often utilized the aesthetic and ritualistic tones of Santería (a religious practice common in Cuba) through the natural symbols of earth, blood, water, and fire. This is seen in Mendieta's most enduring and widely collected work, Silueta (Silhouette, 1973–80). In this series the body is primarily noted through its absence as the artist explored spirituality and performance while also highlighting the historical erasure of, and violence against, women. Mendieta was deeply immersed in feminist art practices of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and her work of the period was aligned with that of contemporaries such as Hannah Wilke (1940–1993) or Carolee Schneemann (b. 1939), who were also extending their visual art practices into the field of body-performance. In Untitled (Body Tracks) (1974), Mendieta eschewed the ubiquitous male gaze, instead using her body to create art forms. In this video performance she stands facing a wall with her arms stretched overhead and slowly falls to her knees, leaving behind a bright red trail of blood in two vertical lines tracking toward each other but never converging. Mendieta was a recipient of the 2009 Cintas Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award in the Visual Arts, awarded posthumously, and her work is in numerous public collections, including those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Art Institute of Chicago; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Musée d'Art Moderne et Contemporain, Geneva; and Tate Modern, London. —January Parkos Arnall.\nSelected Solo Exhibitions 1979 Ana Mendieta, A.I.R.

{"id": 186, "data": "Obituaries | Overlooked No More: Ana Mendieta, a Cuban Artist Who Pushed Boundaries.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/obituaries/ana-mendieta-overlooked.html 4.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story.\nSince 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. By Monica Castillo Ana Mendieta’s art was sometimes violent, often unapologetically feminist and usually raw. She incorporated unusual natural materials like blood, dirt, water and fire, and displayed her work through photography, film and live performances. “Nothing that she did ever surprised me,” Mendieta’s sister, Raquelín, told The New York Times in 2016. “She was always very dramatic, even as a child — and liked to push the envelope, to give people a start, to shock them a little bit. It was who she was, and she enjoyed it very much. And she laughed about it sometimes when people got freaked out.” In the 1973 short film “Moffitt Building Piece,” Mendieta and her sister captured the reactions of strangers who walked by a puddle of pig’s blood that Mendieta had spilled outside her apartment. Some stared and most walked around the mess. Eventually someone washed it off the sidewalk. To Mendieta, the recording offered a thought-provoking experiment on people’s indifference to violence.\n Mendieta’s stature as an artist was never fully recognized in her lifetime. She died in 1985 at 36; her husband, the sculptor Carl Andre, was accused of pushing her out of a window of their 34th-floor apartment in Greenwich Village but was acquitted of murder charges. As an immigrant, Mendieta felt a disconnect in the United States. The trauma of being uprooted from her Cuban homeland as a girl would leave her with questions about her identity and make her more conscious of being a woman of color. These questions would echo in her work, which explored themes that pushed ethnic, sexual, moral, religious and political boundaries. She urged viewers to disregard their gender, race or other defining societal factors and instead connect with the humanity they share with others.\n Image Ana Mendieta, Guanaroca (Esculturas Rupestres), 1981, [First Woman (Rupestrian Sculptures)]. Credit... The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, via Galerie Lelong & Co.\n In this way she gained footing as an ambitious and audacious artist. Writing about a retrospective of her work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York in 2004, the New York Times critic Holland Cotter wrote that “if not naturally fearless,” Mendieta “used fear well, transmuting a profound sense of psychological and cultural displacement into an experience of merging with the natural world and its history through art.” Ana Maria Mendieta was born into a middle-class family in Havana on Nov. 18, 1948. Her father, Ignacio, was a prominent political figure who ran afoul of Fidel Castro’s government; her mother, Raquel, was a chemistry teacher. She and her sister attended a Roman Catholic school on the island before their parents sent them to the United States through Operation Pedro Pan, a secret program run by the church with the aid of the State Department to smuggle thousands of children out of Cuba in the early days of Castro’s regime. The experience would leave Ana, who was 12 at the time, and Raquelín, who was 14, with a feeling of loss as they moved through group and foster homes in Florida and then in Iowa. Mendieta would not see her mother for 5 years, her father for 18. She found refuge in painting and pursued her interests in the arts at the University of Iowa, where she studied under the German artist Hans Breder, who made video and performance art and encouraged students to move back and forth across artistic frontiers. Mendieta adopted those forms and added her own style, mixing elements of performance, body and land art into one work, then capturing it through photography or Super-8 film.\n Image A still from “Butterfly” (1975), a Super-8 film in the 2016 exhibition “Ana Mendieta: Experimental and Interactive Films,” at Galerie Lelong.

The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, via Galerie Lelong & Co.\n In 1973, while she was in college, Mendieta learned about the on-campus rape and murder of a nursing student named Sarah Ann Ottens. Her outrage over the incident drove her to stage one of her most confrontational and violent pieces, “Rape Scene.” For the piece, Mendieta upended her apartment, covered herself with blood and tied herself to a table to recreate the aftermath of brutal sexual assault. She invited an audience to the made-up crime scene, where she remained bent over the table with blood dripping down her legs and pooling at her feet as they discussed the incident. Photographs of the scene are still displayed in museum exhibits around the world, most recently at the Brooklyn Museum earlier this year.\n “There’s a way in which her work is about performance,” Catherine Morris, a senior curator for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the museum, said in a telephone interview. “It’s about theater. It’s about kind of capturing moments through various forms of documentation. And she takes all of these things to the world at large that might not be considered fine arts. She turns them into something intelligent, harrowing and emotional.” Mendieta exemplified this best through a series called “Siluetas,” or “Silhouettes,” which focused on sculptured figures made out of earthy materials like grass, flowers, branches and mud and incorporating themes like creation, faith and womanhood.\n Image “Imagen de Yagul” (“Image from Yagul”) from 1973, one of Mendieta’s best known “Siluetas,” or “Silhouettes.” Credit... The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, via Galerie Lelong & Co.\n In one of her best known “Siluetas,” “Imagen de Yagul” (“Image from Yagul”) from 1973, Mendieta incorporated her body into the piece by lying down nude in an old neglected stone tomb in Mexico. She then strategically placed white flowers over her, as if they were growing out of her body. In all, about 200 pieces make up the series, which she worked on throughout the 1970s and early ’80s. “The making of my ‘Silueta’ in nature keeps the transition between my homeland and my new home,” she once said. “It is a way of reclaiming my roots and becoming one with nature. Although the culture in which I live is part of me, my roots and cultural identity are a result of my Cuban heritage.” Moving to New York City in the late 1970s, Mendieta quickly found a community of fellow artists, including Andre, a sculptor who, like Mendieta, often worked with natural materials. She married him in 1985 despite a tempestuous relationship.\n The circumstances of Mendieta’s death later that year remain a mystery. What is certain is that she plunged from her apartment window in the early hours of Sept. 8, and that her husband was charged with her murder. Over three years of court proceedings, Andre denied the charges. He said that he and Mendieta had argued about his recognition in the art world as surpassing hers. When he walked into their bedroom, he said, she was gone and the window was open. But a passer-by who testified said he had heard cries of a struggle. Andre was acquitted for lack of evidence. To this day, Andre’s shows draw protesters, who blame him for Mendieta’s death. In recent years, awareness of Mendieta’s work has grown considerably, a sign that “the world has caught up,” said Morris, the Brooklyn Museum curator. “They understand her as a pioneer, a maverick and as a great artist,” she said.\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n", "label": [[33, 45, "ARTIST"], [109, 119, "DATE"], [216, 220, "DATE"], [414, 426, "ARTIST"], [696, 704, "ARTIST"], [752, 756, "DATE"], [1013, 1017, "DATE"], [1055, 1063, "ARTIST"], [1158, 1166, "ARTIST"], [1297, 1305, "ARTIST"], [1399, 1407, "ARTIST"], [1487, 1491, "DATE"], [1525, 1535, "ARTIST"], [1613, 1630, "GPE"], [1685, 1693, "ARTIST"], [1715, 1732, "GPE"], [2189, 2201, "ARTIST"], [2203, 2235, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2237, 2241, "DATE"], [2306, 2318, "ARTIST"], [2340, 2359, "GALLERY"], [2480, 2510, "MUSEUM"], [2514, 2522, "GPE"], [2526, 2530, "DATE"], [2613, 2621, "ARTIST"], [2794, 2812, "ARTIST"], [2852, 2858, "GPE"], [2862, 2875, "DATE"], [3120, 3137, "GPE"], [3279, 3283, "GPE"], [3349, 3352, "ARTIST"], [3475, 3482, "GPE"], [3495, 3499, "GPE"], [3501, 3509, "ARTIST"], [3703, 3714, "ARTIST"], [3825, 3833, "ARTIST"], [4020, 4029, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4032, 4036, "DATE"], [4061, 4065, "DATE"], [4078, 4090, "ARTIST"], [4092, 4126, "EVENT"], [4132, 4146, "GALLERY"], [4172, 4184, "ARTIST"], [4206, 4225, "GALLERY"], [4231, 4235, "DATE"], [4263, 4271, "ARTIST"], [4463, 4473, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4491, 4499, "ARTIST"], [4914, 4929, "MUSEUM"], [5006, 5022, "CURATOR"], [5403, 5411, "ARTIST"], [5459, 5467, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5474, 5485, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5660, 5675, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5679, 5695, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5703, 5707, "DATE"], [5716, 5724, "ARTIST"], [5739, 5747, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5754, 5765, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5792, 5804, "ARTIST"], [5826, 5845, "GALLERY"], [5874, 5882, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5886, 5901, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5929, 5933, "DATE"], [5935, 5943, "ARTIST"], [6034, 6040, "GPE"], [6217, 6222, "DATE"], [6233, 6237, "DATE"], [6258, 6265, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6546, 6559, "GPE"], [6572, 6577, "DATE"], [6579, 6587, "ARTIST"], [6643, 6648, "ARTIST"], [6671, 6679, "ARTIST"], [6737, 6741, "DATE"], [6800, 6808, "ARTIST"], [7033, 7038, "ARTIST"], [7079, 7087, "ARTIST"], [7309, 7314, "ARTIST"], [7364, 7369, "ARTIST"], [7413, 7421, "ARTIST"], [7461, 7469, "ARTIST"], [7545, 7551, "CURATOR"], [7557, 7572, "MUSEUM"]]}

Mendietas short career was prolific, beginning with an accomplished and influential body of work created as a graduate student at the University of Iowa. As a student Mendieta became interested in the interaction between performative rituals and sculpture, and important motifs for her life-long practice emerged during these years, including the use of blood, feathers, fire, earth, and the body. Mendieta also began to draw upon and recreate rituals particularly resonant with Afro-Cuban and Catholic traditions, and goddess archetypes. In her work, she left haunting traces of her body fashioned from flowers, tree branches, mud, rocks, sand, gunpowder, and fire. Her fragile yet powerful works speak of the desire to connect with the earth and to explore a mythical relationship with nature. Since her death in 1985 Mendieta has featured in solo exhibitions at major institutions including the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C.; Whitney Museum, New York; Tapiés Foundation in Barcelona; and Castello di Rivoli in Turin;  among others. Her work has been featured in a number of important international group shows including WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution, The Geffen Contemporary, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2007);  Haunted: Contemporary Photography/Video/Performance, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (2010); Ends of the Earth: Land Art to 1974, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2012); A Bigger Splash: Painting After Performance, Tate Modern, London (2012-2013);  Female Power, Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem (MMKA), Arnhem (2013).

In Where Is Ana Mendieta? art historian Jane Blocker provides an in-depth critical analysis of Mendieta’s diverse body of work. Although her untimely death in 1985 remains shrouded in controversy, her life and artistic legacy provide a unique vantage point from which to consider the history of performance art, installation, and earth works, as well as feminism, multiculturalism, and postmodernism. Taken from banners carried in a 1992 protest outside the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the title phrase “Where is Ana Mendieta?” evokes not only the suspicious and tragic circumstances surrounding her death but also the conspicuous absence of women artists from high-profile exhibitions. Drawing on the work of such theorists as Judith Butler, Joseph Roach, Edward Said, and Homi Bhabha, Blocker discusses the power of Mendieta’s earth-and-body art to alter, unsettle, and broaden the terms of identity itself. She shows how Mendieta used exile as a discursive position from which to disrupt dominant categories, analyzing as well Mendieta’s use of mythology and anthropology, the ephemeral nature of her media, and the debates over her ethnic, gender, and national identities. As the first major critical examination of this enigmatic artist’s work,.\nWhere Is Ana Mendieta? will interest a broad audience, particularly those involved with the production, criticism, theory, and history of contemporary art. .\nPrevious page Print length 184 pages.\nLanguage English.\nPublisher Duke University Press Books.\nPublication date February 24, 1999.\nDimensions 6 x 0.46 x 9.25 inches.\nISBN-10 0822323249.\nISBN-13 978-0822323242.\nLexile measure 1410L.\nSee all details.\nNext page.\nhtml Frequently bought together + +.\nTotal price: To see our price, add these items to your cart.

Mendieta came to the United States in 1961 and spent her adolescence in Iowa. The trauma of dislocation from her family and homeland is a recurrent theme in her work. Mendieta died from injuries sustained in a tragic fall from a window in her New York City apartment building at the age of 37. Latino Art and Culture Bilingual Study Guide (Washington, D.C.: National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1996).\nAna Mendieta was a sculptor, and a performance and conceptual artist. She was born in Havana, Cuba, and came to the United States in 1961, when many Cubans were fleeing Fidel Castro’s régime. Mendieta and her sisters were raised in different orphanages and foster homes in Iowa. Although she eventually studied at the Center for the New Performing Arts at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, she always considered herself an artist in exile. Mendieta often used her body as a template for silhouettes shaped in mud. Carving directly into the clay bed, she reestablished connections with her ancestors and ancestral land. This female contour inscribed in the earth recalls earth goddesses of ancient cultures, reflecting Mendieta’s feminist stance. The art of carving provided Mendieta with a link to the past, a renewed sense of power in the present, and a bond to the timeless universe. As she remarked poetically, ​“I have thrown myself into the very elements that produced me, using the earth as my canvas and my soul as my tools.” She made this photograph as a record of her ephemeral sculpture.

{"id": 194, "data": "Home / Where Is Ana Mendieta?.\nWhere Is Ana Mendieta? Identity, Performativity, and Exile.\nShare.\nBook Pages: 184 Illustrations: 29 b&w photographs Published: February 1999.\nAuthor: \nJane  Blocker Subjects\nGender and Sexuality > Feminism and Women’s Studies,  Theater and Performance > Performance Art,  Art and Visual Culture > Feminist Art Ana Mendieta, a Cuban-born artist who lived in exile in the United States, was one of the most provocative and complex personalities of the 1970s’ artworld. In Where Is Ana Mendieta? art historian Jane Blocker provides an in-depth critical analysis of Mendieta’s diverse body of work. Although her untimely death in 1985 remains shrouded in controversy, her life and artistic legacy provide a unique vantage point from which to consider the history of performance art, installation, and earth works, as well as feminism, multiculturalism, and postmodernism. Taken from banners carried in a 1992 protest outside the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the title phrase “Where is Ana Mendieta?” evokes not only the suspicious and tragic circumstances surrounding her death but also the conspicuous absence of women artists from high-profile exhibitions. Drawing on the work of such theorists as Judith Butler, Joseph Roach, Edward Said, and Homi Bhabha, Blocker discusses the power of Mendieta’s earth-and-body art to alter, unsettle, and broaden the terms of identity itself. She shows how Mendieta used exile as a discursive position from which to disrupt dominant categories, analyzing as well Mendieta’s use of mythology and anthropology, the ephemeral nature of her media, and the debates over her ethnic, gender, and national identities. As the first major critical examination of this enigmatic artist’s work, Where Is Ana Mendieta? will interest a broad audience, particularly those involved with the production, criticism, theory, and history of contemporary art. .\nPraise “Effectively arguing that Mendieta is not the earth mother her detractors make her out to be, Blocker’s premise is that Mendieta’s earthworks were more performative than sculptural. . . . Blocker poses the strong link between earth and nation, resulting in a re-reading of Mendieta’s work that is highly political and makes free use of the post-colonial strategies of theorists such as Homi Bhaba and Edward Said. Blocker shrewdly challenges fellow critics, taking on the gamut of biting and dismissive critiques. . . . In the progressive, enlightened ’90s, when a sculpture by Carl Andre is still the more valued acquisition, Where is Ana Mendieta? is one of the few books that attempts the correction of this grave negligence. Weighty and thoughtful, Blocker has written a precise and convincing analysis of Ana Mendieta’s overwhelming significance as an artist.” — ,  New Art Examiner “This book offers a more rigorous historical and cultural analysis than earlier texts on Ana Mendieta. It adds usefully to one’s understanding of Mendieta’s work and will contribute to her insertion into history.” — Mira Schor, author of Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art Culture “This is a very important study of one of the most ambitious and intriguing artists of our time.

She was born in 1948 in Cuba, and was sent by her parents at the age of twelve, together with her sister, to be raised in the United States. She died in New York in 1985, at the age of thirty-six. Her pioneering work has been acknowledged by large retrospectives in the United States and Europe, and is represented in the collections of major museums. Long overdue in the German-speaking area, especially in Austria, are a comprehensive exhibition and German monograph on Ana Mendieta. The exhibition at the Museum der Moderne Salzburg presents a comprehensive overview, with roughly 150 central works in diverse media ranging from photography, film, and sculpture through to drawing. A large section of the show will present the artist’s archive: slides and photographs, notebooks and postcards will be specially prepared for the exhibition. Curators: Stephanie Rosenthal, Chief Curator of the Hayward Gallery, and Sabine Breitwieser, Director, Museum der Moderne Salzburg, with Tina Teufel, Curator, Museum der Moderne Salzburg In Dialogue: Viennese Actionism\nFor the first time, the Museum der Moderne Salzburg is devoting a special exhibition to artists and works from the collection associated with so-called Viennese Actionism: Günter Brus, Adolf Frohner, Otto Muehl, Hermann Nitsch, Rudolf Schwarzkogler, and also Anestis Logothetis. In addition, one space will exhibit works by women artists who introduce an entirely different concept of the body and a new image of women, while connecting it with a media critique: Renate Bertlmann, VALIE EXPORT, and Friederike Pezold. This special focus on the Museum der Moderne Salzburg’s collection provides access to astonishing holdings; impressive in range and with hitherto rarely shown material. Thus its diversity makes us reading a history of the representation of body-based art and its various articulations in the museum context during the past decades. This exhibition will take place parallel to the retrospective of Ana Mendieta and in dialogue with her work. During her studies with Hans Breder at the Intermedia Program of the School of Art and Art History at the University of Iowa, USA, which Breder ran from 1968 for more than three decades, Mendieta came into contact with the work of artists such as Vito Acconci, Mary Beth Edelson, Hans Haacke, Allan Kaprow, and Robert Wilson, but also with the Viennese Actionists. Clear resonances are evident in Mendieta’s performances and artistic practice. A few of the connections that we are able to recognize today are—to name a few—the radical use of the body as artistic means, the precise selection of photographs assigned the task of mediating performance-based works in the gallery context, and the experimental use of concepts and disciplines. Curators: Sabine Breitwieser, Director, with Barbara Herzog, Assistant Curator, Museum der Moderne Salzburg Symposium on the exhibitions\nSaturday, March 29, 2:30–7:30pm On the occasion of these two exhibitions—Ana Mendieta. Traces and In Dialogue: Viennese Actionism—the Museum der Moderne Salzburg is organizing a symposium in which the exhibited artists and works will be examined as prime case studies of body- and performance-based art, along with their implementation in art institutions. A few of the connections that we are able to recognize today are the—in part radical—confrontations with the body as an artistic means, deliberate selection of photographs that are assigned the task of mediating a performative work in the gallery context, as well as the experimental treatment of concepts and disciplines.

Yet in her lifetime, the artist resisted labels, claiming that she was neither a performance artist nor a land artist, not even a feminist if the term referred to the mainstream movement of white middle-class women. Still, Mendieta’s pioneering art was overshadowed, both because her death in 1985 came to define her legacy, and because the art world seemed to be put off by the visceral quality of her work. In 2013, art critic Rachel Spence wrote: “The combination of her Cuban origins allied to her interest in violence, magic, and death, and her practice of making art out of her own body and nature, saw her dismissed by the western establishment as a tragic, exotic earth mother.” Now, Galerie Lelong, which manages Mendieta’s estate, is casting a light on a body of work that was believed to be lost and destroyed. Opening October 17 in New York, La Tierra Habla (The Earth Speaks) is the first exhibition and catalogue dedicated to a series of sculptures Mendieta produced in Cuba in 1981. Being uprooted from her Cuban homeland as a child, Mendieta took on exile as an identity, never fully integrating into either the United States or Cuba. The work reflects her search for meaning and poses questions about culture and identity. Returning to Cuba for the first time in 1980, Ana declared: “I was afraid before I went because I felt ‘here I’ve been living my life with this obsessive thing in my mind – what if I find out it has nothing to do with me?’ But the minute I got there it was this whole thing of belonging again.” Ahead of the exhibition, we look back at her journey to the source.\n Pixy Liao’s provocative photos subvert the artist-muse dynamic Vivek Vadoliya’s vivid photos of the ancient Indian art of mallakhamb This book captures the complex, unseen world of strip clubs Candid portraits of London’s Latinx community at home.\nAna Mendieta, Maroya, (Esculturas Rupestres/Light of Day (Rupestrian Sculptures)), (1981), black and white, 40.75 x 53.25 inches.\nCopyright the Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC.

Licensed by Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.\nGOING HOME TO CUBA Ana Mendieta arrived at Miami International Airport on September 11, 1961, as part of an exodus of 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban children known as Operation Peter Pan. At age 12, she was sent to the US with her 15-year-old sister Raquelín because her parents feared the politics of Fidel Castro, who had seized power two years prior. The Mendieta sisters spent their adolescence between Catholic-run group and foster homes across Iowa until they reunited with their mother and brother in 1966. Ana would only return to Cuba in 1980 as part of a group that promoted cultural exchange between Cuba and the US. After 19-years in exile, she reconnected with her family in Havana and Varadero, a resort town that sits on a narrow peninsula east of the capital. She was the first artist to receive permission from the government to create work on the island. In 1981, she made sand sculptures in Guanabo beach and carved and painted several works in rocks near Varadero. She began planning Rupestrian Sculptures, a series of works located in Escaleras de Jaruco Park, on the outskirts of Havana. Having experienced orphanhood and alienation in the US, Mendieta sought a sense of belonging by experimenting with her homeland’s soft limestone and undulating landscapes. Art was a way to connect with her birthplace and personal background, but also with Cuba’s history of resistance. The park of Jaruco, a small crop of green forest and hillocks, caves and cliffs, was once inhabited by Native Cubans and served as a refuge for political rebels throughout the ages. Raquel Cecilia Mendieta, Ana Mendieta’s niece, told Dazed: “Working in Jaruco was like a way to create her own myths by leaving her abstracted forms within the caves that previous Cuban rebels had used as a refuge in the War for Independence from Spain.” SHE BONDED WITH NATURE Ana Mendieta is often associated with Earth art, a movement that rejects the commercialisation of art-making and uses materials of the Earth-like soil, rocks, or water found on-site. But unlike land artists, who almost always introduce changes in the natural environment, her work attempts to integrate into it. In fact, Mendieta condemned land artists for having “brutalised nature” with their invasive methods. “This is a very tender, indigenous approach to working with the earth,” says Raquel Cecilia Mendieta. “Creating under the notion that humans should honour this land and not treat it with violence.” While in Cuba, Mendieta made sculptures using sand or carving into the fine rocks that are typical of the north of the island. In a proposal from 1981, she wrote:  “I usually work alone, using in the creation of the works the suggestions that the same natural forms provoke in me.”.\nAna Mendieta, “Bacayu (Esculturas Rupestres/Light of Day (Rupestrian Sculptures)), (1981), black and white photograph, 40 x 55 inches.\nCopyright the Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC.

Licensed by Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.\nSHE DREW FROM INDIGENOUS CULTURE AND MYTHS The sculptures in Varadero and Jaruco are named after goddesses from the pre-colonial Taíno culture, indigenous to the Caribbean. Mendieta had referred to Afro-Cuban and indigenous traditions before, most famously in her first Silueta, for which she lay down on a Zapotec tomb with flowers all over her body. A passion for history ran in the Mendieta family. Elvira, Ana’s grandmother, collected archival materials that she later donated to her uncle, who was involved in the founding of the Museo Oscar María de Rojas in Cárdenas, Cuba’s second oldest museum. According to Raquel Cecilia Mendieta, children in Cuba learned about Meso-American history at school and so Ana developed an interest in indigenous cultures from an early age. The women in the Jaruco caves are dedicated to Albohoa, (Goddess of Beauty), Atabey (Mother of the Waters), Bacayu (Light of Day), Guacar (First Menstruation), Guabancex (Wind Goddess), Guanaroca (First Woman), Itiba Cahubaba (Old Mother of the Blood), Iyare (Mother Goddess), and Maroya (Moon Goddess). Ana did not base the sculptures on any images or reproduced representations of the goddesses, but rather, paid homage to them. In fact, Mendieta only named the sculptures after Tainan deities once they were completed. THE MAGICAL POWER OF REPRESENTATION We know that Mendieta was also interested in Santería, a religion she was introduced to through the African-Cuban servants who lived in her family’s home. But her interest went beyond a fascination with spells, potions, and saints. Speaking to Linda Montano for Sulfur magazine, Mendieta said: “I was raised a Catholic and can’t deny my heritage... but as I’ve continued to work I feel closer to the Neolithic. Now I believe in water, air, and earth. They are all deities. They also speak.” \"In Cuba, her family rejected those rituals because they were considered “low class,” but Mendieta believed in their power regardless. “I don’t know why people have gotten away from those ideas,” she added.\" Mendieta explained the significance of those beliefs on her work early on, as an MFA student at the University of Iowa: “It seems as if these cultures are provided with an inner knowledge, a closeness to natural resources. And it is this knowledge which gives reality to the images they have created. It is this sense of magic, knowledge, and power, found in primitive art, that influences my personal attitude to art-making.” For the artist, the elements were living bodies, and she wanted to be one with them. In fleeing her home country, Mendieta was separated from her family, but in some sense, from nature as well. Her artwork tries to overcome this separation.\n Ana Mendieta, “Untitled”, (1981), black and white photograph, 39.25 x 53.5 inches.\nCopyright the Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC.

Licensed by Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.\nPHOTOGRAPHY BECAME THE WORK “Ana created works in the landscape knowing that they would eventually deteriorate and merge with nature,” says Raquel Cecilia Mendieta. Mendieta documented her on-site work meticulously, creating large photographic enlargements and videos, that would eventually “be the works”. The photographs of the Cuban carvings were shown at A.I.R. gallery in November 1981, just months after completion of the sculptures. “She was searching for a way to bring the experience of the works in situ to the viewer,” Raquel Cecilia Mendieta says, “and eventually realised that if she printed the photographs larger, as she called it, ‘human scale’, the works would have more of a presence and would re-create the feeling of being in the space.” SHE CRITIQUED MAINSTREAM FEMINISM Though she exhibited with the women’s collective A.I.R. Gallery from 1978 to 1982, Mendieta was wary of being pigeonholed as a feminist, or merely as a Latina artist. “Ana had always struggled against identifying with the mainstream feminist movement,” Raquel Cecilia Mendieta explains. “In fact, the year prior to creating the Rupestrian Sculptures series in Cuba, she curated Dialectics of Isolation: An Exhibition of Third World Women Artists of the United States at A.I.R. Gallery, New York, with Kazuko Miyamoto and Zarina. She wrote an incisive criticism in the exhibition catalogue: ‘…American Feminism as it stands is basically a white middle-class movement.’  But at the same time, she thought of nature as being female and didn’t argue the fact that she was a woman and therefore her work was an expression of her experience as a woman.” La tierra habla (The Earth Speaks) runs at Galerie Lelong from 17 October – 16 November 2019.\nArt & Photography Feature Lists Ana Mendieta exhibition Exhibitions \n", "label": [[104, 118, "DATE"], [262, 266, "GPE"], [327, 341, "DATE"], [363, 375, "ARTIST"], [378, 412, "WORK_OF_ART"], [417, 429, "ARTIST"], [459, 462, "DATE"], [467, 470, "DATE"], [823, 831, "ARTIST"], [893, 897, "DATE"], [1012, 1016, "DATE"], [1292, 1306, "GALLERY"], [1322, 1330, "ARTIST"], [1430, 1440, "DATE"], [1444, 1452, "GPE"], [1454, 1488, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1563, 1571, "ARTIST"], [1584, 1588, "GPE"], [1592, 1596, "DATE"], [1649, 1657, "ARTIST"], [1724, 1741, "GPE"], [1745, 1749, "GPE"], [1853, 1857, "GPE"], [1880, 1884, "DATE"], [1886, 1889, "ARTIST"], [2204, 2214, "ARTIST"], [2267, 2281, "ARTIST"], [2417, 2423, "GPE"], [2452, 2464, "ARTIST"], [2466, 2472, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2536, 2540, "DATE"], [2606, 2618, "ARTIST"], [2645, 2665, "GALLERY"], [2708, 2716, "GPE"], [2732, 2736, "GPE"], [2737, 2749, "ARTIST"], [2792, 2810, "DATE"], [2929, 2935, "GPE"], [3072, 3080, "ARTIST"], [3222, 3226, "DATE"], [3253, 3257, "GPE"], [3261, 3265, "DATE"], [3325, 3329, "GPE"], [3334, 3340, "GPE"], [3348, 3356, "DATE"], [3402, 3408, "GPE"], [3413, 3421, "GPE"], [3590, 3594, "DATE"], [3624, 3631, "GPE"], [3689, 3697, "GPE"], [3816, 3822, "GPE"], [3872, 3878, "GPE"], [3880, 3888, "ARTIST"], [4080, 4084, "GPE"], [4122, 4128, "GPE"], [4317, 4329, "ARTIST"], [4539, 4544, "GPE"], [4570, 4582, "ARTIST"], [4891, 4899, "ARTIST"], [5190, 5194, "GPE"], [5196, 5204, "ARTIST"], [5327, 5331, "DATE"], [5464, 5476, "ARTIST"], [5479, 5545, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5548, 5552, "DATE"], [5623, 5635, "ARTIST"], [5662, 5682, "GALLERY"], [5725, 5733, "GPE"], [5796, 5804, "GPE"], [5809, 5815, "GPE"], [5897, 5906, "GPE"], [5908, 5916, "ARTIST"], [6005, 6012, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6120, 6128, "ARTIST"], [6145, 6148, "ARTIST"], [6270, 6296, "MUSEUM"], [6300, 6314, "GPE"], [6389, 6393, "GPE"], [6447, 6450, "ARTIST"], [6532, 6538, "GPE"], [6819, 6822, "ARTIST"], [6955, 6963, "ARTIST"], [7086, 7094, "ARTIST"], [7352, 7360, "ARTIST"], [7568, 7572, "GPE"], [7654, 7662, "ARTIST"], [7772, 7780, "ARTIST"], [8441, 8453, "ARTIST"], [8456, 8464, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8468, 8472, "DATE"], [8548, 8560, "ARTIST"], [8587, 8607, "GALLERY"], [8650, 8658, "GPE"], [8689, 8692, "ARTIST"], [8825, 8833, "ARTIST"], [9019, 9033, "GALLERY"], [9037, 9050, "DATE"], [9501, 9515, "GALLERY"], [9521, 9533, "DATE"], [9535, 9543, "ARTIST"], [9620, 9623, "ARTIST"], [9905, 9918, "GPE"], [9922, 9936, "GALLERY"], [9938, 9946, "GPE"], [9953, 9968, "ARTIST"], [9973, 9979, "ARTIST"], [10300, 10334, "EVENT"], [10343, 10357, "GALLERY"], [10363, 10392, "DATE"], [10426, 10438, "ARTIST"]]}

His works reach some of the highest prices in the art market among living photographers. His photograph Rhein II was sold for $4,338,500 on 8 November 2011.[2] Gursky shares a studio with Laurenz Berges, Thomas Ruff and Axel Hütte on the Hansaallee, in Düsseldorf.[3] The building, a former electricity station, was transformed into an artists studio and living quarters, in 2001, by architects Herzog & de Meuron, of Tate Modern fame.[4] In 2010–11, the architects worked again on the building, designing a gallery in the basement.[5] Contents 1 Education.\n2 Career and style.\n3 Art market.\n4 Publications.\n5 Exhibitions.\n6 Collections.\n7 See also.\n8 References.\n9 External links.\nEducation[edit] Gursky was born in Leipzig, East Germany in 1955. His family relocated to West Germany, moving to Essen and then Düsseldorf by the end of 1957.[6] From 1978 to 1981, he attended the Universität Gesamthochschule Essen, where he studied visual communication, led by photographers Otto Steinert and Michael Schmidt.[7] Gursky is said to have attended the university to hear Otto Steinert, however Steinert died in 1978 and Gursky only got to attend a few of his lectures.[8] Between 1981 and 1987 at the Düsseldorf Art Academy, Gursky received critical training and influence from his teachers Hilla and Bernd Becher,[9][10] a photographic team known for their distinctive, dispassionate method of systematically cataloging industrial machinery and architecture.[11] Gursky demonstrates a similarly methodical approach in his own larger-scale photography. Other notable influences are the British landscape photographer John Davies, whose highly detailed high vantage point images had a strong effect on the street level photographs Gursky was then making, and to a lesser degree the American photographer Joel Sternfeld.[citation needed] Career and style[edit] Before the 1990s, Gursky did not digitally manipulate his images.[12] In the years since, Gursky has been frank about his reliance on computers to edit and enhance his pictures, creating an art of spaces larger than the subjects photographed.[citation needed] Writing in The New Yorker magazine, the critic Peter Schjeldahl called these pictures \"vast,\" \"splashy,\" \"entertaining,\" and \"literally unbelievable.\"[13] In the same publication, critic Calvin Tomkins described Gursky as one of the \"two masters\" of the Düsseldorf School of Photography. In 2001, Tomkins described the experience of confronting one of Gursky's large works:[9] The first time I saw photographs by Andreas Gursky...I had the disorienting sensation that something was happening—happening to me, I suppose, although it felt more generalized than that. Gursky's huge, panoramic colour prints—some of them up to six feet high by ten feet long—had the presence, the formal power, and in several cases the majestic aura of nineteenth-century landscape paintings, without losing any of their meticulously detailed immediacy as photographs. Their subject matter was the contemporary world, seen dispassionately and from a distance.[9] The perspective in many of Gursky's photographs is drawn from an elevated vantage point. This position enables the viewer to encounter scenes, encompassing both centre and periphery, which are ordinarily beyond reach.[14] This sweeping perspective has been linked to an engagement with globalization.[15] Visually, Gursky is drawn to large, anonymous, man-made spaces—high-rise facades at night, office lobbies, stock exchanges, the interiors of big box retailers (See his print 99 Cent II Diptychon). In a 2001 retrospective, New York's Museum of Modern Art described the artist's work, \"a sophisticated art of unembellished observation. It is thanks to the artfulness of Gursky's fictions that we recognize his world as our own.\"[16] Gursky's style is enigmatic and deadpan. There is little to no explanation or manipulation on the works. His photography is straightforward.[17] Gursky's Dance Valley festival photograph, taken near Amsterdam in 1995, depicts attendees facing a DJ stand in a large arena, beneath strobe lighting effects. The pouring smoke resembles a human hand, holding the crowd in stasis. After completing the print, Gursky explained the only music he now listens to is the anonymous, beat-heavy style known as Trance, as its symmetry and simplicity echoes his own work—while playing towards a deeper, more visceral emotion.[citation needed] The photograph 99 Cent (1999) was taken at a 99 Cents Only store on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and depicts its interior as a stretched horizontal composition of parallel shelves, intersected by vertical white columns, in which the abundance of \"neatly labeled packets are transformed into fields of colour, generated by endless arrays of identical products, reflecting off the shiny ceiling\" (Wyatt Mason).[18] Rhein II (1999), depicts a stretch of the river Rhine outside Düsseldorf, immediately legible as a view of a straight stretch of water, but also as an abstract configuration of horizontal bands of colour of varying widths.[19] In his six-part series Ocean I-VI (2009–2010), Gursky used high-definition satellite photographs which he augmented from various picture sources on the Internet.[20] Art market[edit] Most of Gursky's photographs come in editions of six with two artist's proofs.[21] Since 2010, Gursky has been represented by Gagosian Gallery.[22] As of end 2011, he holds a current record for highest price paid at auction for a single photographic image. His print Rhein II sold for US$4,338,500 at Christie's, New York on 8 November 2011.[23][24] In 2013, Chicago Board of Trade III (1999–2009) sold for 2.2 million pounds, an auction record for a Gursky exchange photo.[25] Publications[edit] Andreas Gursky .

On a formal level, countless interrelated micro and macrostructures are woven together, determined by an overall organizational principle.\n—Andreas Gursky From images of nature to photographs of cities, crowds, and commercial products, Andreas Gursky invents new worlds from existing elements, constructing tableaux based on his methodical observations. In his large-format, high-definition photographs, he presents hyperfocused scenes that privilege neither foreground nor background. Gursky studied visual communication at the Folkwang Universität der Künste in Essen, Germany, from 1977 to 1980. He then continued his studies at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he was a master-class student of Bernd and Hilla Becher, the artist duo known for their series of photographs of selected types of industrial structures, or “typologies.” While the Bechers used a standardized, documentary style to underscore the commonality inherent in variation, Gursky’s studies propelled him to expand the idea of the photographic document by using digital manipulation and montage to record specific scenes, moments, and events. His works from the early 1990s depict factories, stock exchanges, airports, golf courses, highways, and buildings, often from aerial viewpoints that reveal the patterns of crowds and infrastructure. In 1996 he moved away from this perspective in favor of deadpan frontal views, as in the Prada series (1996–98), depicting the minimalist altars of luxury fashion, or, as in Prada II (1997), showing the empty shelves lit with fluorescent lights. In the early 2000s Gursky began arranging his photographic montages according to classical patterns of representation. The Pyongyang photographs (2007), in particular—which show colorful, kaleidoscopic crowds of performers in North Korea—recall compositional methods used during the Renaissance. Gursky followed this series with photographs of more informal crowds, such as those at Cocoon, a famous German nightclub designed by his friend DJ Sven Väth. The club, with its perforated metallic walls, resembles a futuristic hive, and Gursky used its cavernous scale to produce hypnotic scenes that envelop the viewer in their repeated patterns. In addition to his work focusing on social phenomena, entertainment, and urban planning, Gursky is interested in capturing the realities of the planet, often narrowing in on bodies of water, from the Rhine in Germany to the Chao Phraya in Thailand. The Bangkok series (2011) depicts the flickering, often littered, surface of this fast-flowing river at close range. For the Ocean works (2010), Gursky sourced high-definition satellite photography to generate his own interpretations of sea and land, constructing scenes of oceanic expanses with coastlines visible at the images’ outermost edges. From environmental threats to growing crowds and infrastructural development, Gursky’s photographs capture the extremes of the present moment.\n Photo: Joerg Koch/DDP/Getty Images #AndreasGursky Facebook Twitter E-mail.\nDownloads Selected exhibition history (PDF)\nSelected bibliography (PDF).\nWebsite andreasgursky.com.\nExhibitions Andreas Gursky May 5–June 18, 2022 541 West 24th Street, New York.\nAndreas Gursky February 1–March 17, 2019 Tarmak22, Gstaad Saanen Airport, Switzerland.\nI Don’t Like Fiction, I Like History\n            \nDuane Hanson with Thomas Demand, Andreas Gursky, Sharon Lockhart, and Jeff Wall September 5–28, 2018 Beverly Hills.\nExtended through March 10, 2018 Andreas Gursky\n            \nBangkok December 14, 2017–March 10, 2018 Rome.\nAndreas Gursky\n            \nNot Abstract II November 10–December 23, 2016 West 21st Street, New York.\nAndreas Gursky May 15–June 16, 2012 Hong Kong.\nAndreas Gursky November 4–December 17, 2011 West 21st Street, New York.\nAndreas Gursky March 4–May 1, 2010 Beverly Hills.\nSee all Exhibitions for Andreas Gursky.\nFrom the Quarterly Ive by Gursky: A Meeting of Minds By exploring the conventions of past portraits of industrial designers and architects, Maria Morris Hambourg unpacks Andreas Gursky’s ingenious recent portrait of Apple designer Jony Ive to reveal its layered meanings.\n Donald Marron Jacoba Urist profiles the legendary collector.\n Cast of Characters James Lawrence explores how contemporary artists have grappled with the subject of the library.\n Veil and Vault An exhibition at the Broad in Los Angeles prompts James Lawrence to examine how artists give shape and meaning to the passage of time, and how the passage of time shapes our evolving accounts of art.\n Unreal Americans Benjamin Nugent reflects on questions of verisimilitude and American life in the group exhibition I Don’t Like Fiction, I Like History at Gagosian, Beverly Hills.\n In Conversation\nAndreas Gursky and Jeff Wall On the occasion of a major survey of Andreas Gursky’s work at the Hayward Gallery in London, Gursky and Jeff Wall discuss the state of photography and the evolution of the medium.\n Gagosian Quarterly Summer 2018 The Summer 2018 Gagosian Quarterly issue is now available, featuring El Ejido, one of Andreas Gursky’s latest artworks, on its cover.\n In Conversation\nAndreas Gursky Andreas Gursky and Richie Hawtin discuss their collaboration with art historian Laura Käding.\n Andreas Gursky Parrish Art Museum Terrie Sultan, Director of the Parrish Art Museum, discusses Andreas Gursky: Landscapes (2015).\n Fairs, Events & Announcements December 2–4, 2021, booth D5\nMiami Beach Convention Center\nartbasel.com Gagosian is pleased to announce its participation in Art Basel Miami Beach 2021 with a presentation of modern and contemporary works.

He is known for his large format architecture and landscape colour photographs, often using a high point of view in most of his photos. His works reach some of the highest prices in the art market among living photographers. His photograph Rhein II was sold for $4,338,500 on 8 November 2011. Gursky shares a studio with Laurenz Berges, Thomas Ruff and Axel Hütte on the Hansaallee, in Düsseldorf. The building, a former electricity station, was transformed into an artists studio and living quarters, in 2001, by architects Herzog & de Meuron, of Tate Modern fame. In 2010–11, the architects worked again on the building, designing a gallery in the basement. This biography is from Wikipedia under an Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons License.

Pictured through a window and from behind, they gaze at a huge abstract painting on the wall in front of them. The moment would have been incredible to capture — had it ever happened. In fact, the image is a digital composition by the German photographer Andreas Gursky, who constructed it using pictures of the four chancellors he took separately. “Review” (2015) is one of nearly 70 works on display in the new retrospective of the artist’s work at the Hayward Gallery here. The exhibition, which opened on Jan. 25, is the gallery’s first after renovations that took just over two years to complete.\n Image “Rhine II” set a record for the highest price paid for a single photograph at auction when it sold for $4.3 million in 2011.

The Hayward exhibition includes this and other famous Gursky views from the 1990s: a sprawling Paris apartment building, a 99-cent store, swarms of traders on stock exchange floors. Striking in their scale and resolution, they show humankind dwarfed by nature, industry, finance and the consumer society. In recent years, Mr. Gursky has set out to test the boundaries of photography by composing works almost entirely in the studio, digitally creating spaces and scenes that never existed. The question is whether these are works that he will be remembered by. In an interview at the Hayward before the opening, Mr. Gursky sat between two of his giant new compositions, both of them inspired by pictures he took with his smartphone. Placid and measured in his words, he wore a navy sweater and a string bracelet not normally seen on the wrist of a 63-year-old man. Speaking in English and occasionally reverting to German, with a translator on hand, he engaged in a wide-ranging conversation about art and success — and his passion for techno music. Mr. Gursky began by explaining his recent output. “I’m just interested in making images,” he said. “And, of course, you have to reinvent yourself.” He pointed out that he made no more than eight images a year, and that they took time to produce. The exhibition’s curator, Hayward’s director Ralph Rugoff (who was recently named as the artistic director of the 2019 Venice Biennale), said he chose to reopen the Hayward with Mr. Gursky because “he’s changed the language of photography in so many ways.” As examples, Mr. Rugoff mentioned “Review” and “Untitled XVI” (2008), in which the hivelike space in the picture was entirely fabricated using architectural software. Those “completely constructed” works of recent years were among Mr. Gursky’s best, Mr. Rugoff said, because he was establishing a dialogue with abstract art and composing pictures the way a painter would.\n From the very birth of the discipline, Mr. Rugoff said, “people were doing darkroom tricks and making things appear in photography that weren’t there.” Image Mr Gursky’s retrospective is the first show at the Hayward Gallery after a two-year renovation. Credit... Tom Jamieson for The New York Times.\n“This medium, which we, for official purposes like passports and school IDs, trust to be an accurate picture of the world, has always been something that can be lent to fiction as well as to fact,” he explained. “Andreas is not a journalist doing reportage.” Other specialists expressed a preference for Mr. Gursky’s earlier work. Quentin Bajac, the chief curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York — where Mr. Gursky’s retrospective in 2001 gave the photographer a major career boost — said his signature pieces of the ’90s came “at a perfect moment,” just as globalization was gathering pace. Mr. Gursky represented the spread of multinationals and the explosion of financial markets, as they were striking “the right balance between something that is neither critical nor apologetic,” Mr. Bajac said. That “absence of narrative” mirrored the contemporary mood. Mr. Gursky’s work also embodied the shift from analog to digital, from “taking images” to “making images,” said Mr. Bajac — initially doing both but now doing more of the latter. Mr. Gursky was born in Leipzig (then in East Germany) and left when he was 1 year old. His father set up a successful commercial photography studio in Düsseldorf, in the West, so the little boy grew up surrounded by a lab and camera equipment. Though initially determined not to follow in his father’s footsteps, he ended up getting a photography degree from the Folkwang University of the Arts, in nearby Essen, because “to be honest, I didn’t know what I could do.”.\nIn 1980, he enrolled at the Düsseldorf Art Academy to study with the pioneering teacher Bernd Becher, whose other disciples — Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff, Candida Höfer — also went on to become prominent photographers. While there, Mr. Gursky started taking color panoramas of mountains, camping sites and swimming pools featuring tiny human beings. A switch to digital photography in the early ’90s allowed Mr. Gursky to take large-format photographs and to manipulate the images in digital postproduction — by “pumping up the color sometimes or combining several different images in order to get this really even perspective, where you can see everything and details that aren’t available from just one perspective are suddenly made available to you,” Mr. Rugoff explained. The giant formats found a ready market. Photography had historically been black-and-white and small, and printed in large editions. Mr. Gursky blew it up, made full use of color and set out to “document the key themes that dominate our lives today, then produce these works in limited editions of between four and six,” said Francis Outred, the chairman and head of postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s, one of the Hayward show’s sponsors. He created “a capsule of value” akin to a painting, Mr. Outred said.\n Image From left, “Frankfurt,” 2017, “Beijing,” 2010, and “Review,” 2015. Credit... Andreas Gursky/ 2018 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Mark Blower/Hayward Gallery.\nMr. Gursky also outpriced his peers by pointing his lens, early on, at major world exchanges such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1990 and the Chicago Board of Trade in 1997. “If you’re looking for an Andy Warhol, you want a Marilyn, and if you’re looking for a Gursky, you want a stock exchange,” Mr. Outred said, adding that one London hedge fund had collected four or five of them to decorate its trading floor. At the turn of the millennium, Mr. Gursky started digitally recomposing photographs to give them a look similar to abstract paintings. In his record-setting river view “Rhine II” (1999), for instance, the perfectly straight lines of green and gray recall abstract paintings by Barnett Newman or Kenneth Noland. Mr. Gursky edited out a power station that spoiled the composition.\n Mr. Gursky meanwhile continued to capture images around the theme of labor and capital. “Amazon” (2016) shows one of the online retailer’s Arizona warehouses, stocked with books and boxes, and plastered with motivational slogans that read: “Work hard,” “Have fun” and “Make history.” Image In “Amazon,” 2016, Mr. Gursky photographed the online retailer’s Arizona warehouse. Credit... Andreas Gursky/ 2018 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; VG BILD-KUNST, Bonn., via Sprüth Magers.\nMr. Gursky said visiting the warehouse was tough because of the working conditions, but insisted that his images were not “accusing” or a “political statement.” “Our world is also seduced by Amazon, because it’s so practical and so quick, and you want something and the next day you have it. This is also the truth,” he said. “I show our contemporary world the way it is.” Asked if his fame and fortune caused him discomfort, Mr. Gursky laughed. Money had, of course, changed his life, he said, because he could afford to travel wherever he wanted. He said he planned to use his wealth to set up a public foundation on the premises of his studio in Düsseldorf, which he would endow and where all of the prints reserved for his private collection would be viewed in the future. Will it open soon?.\n“No, I’m still a bit too young,” he said with a smile. He had thought about the foundation for a long time, he said, and was happy to have reached a decision: “It’s strange for a living artist to talk about what’s going on after he has died.” For now, Mr. Gursky leads the life of a much younger man. He plays sports — tennis, jogging and cycling — and has been a fan of techno for the past 20 years, describing it as music for all generations. He is close friends with the D.J. Sven Väth and other techno performers. “My son complains that I’m hearing the same music as him,” said Mr. Gursky, referring to the youngest of his two children, who are in their 20s. “Maybe he has a problem with this, but not me!”.\nImage “Hamm, Bergwerk Ost,” (2008) shows the hanging belongings of miners at a German coal mine.

Andreas Gursky/ 2018 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Mark Blower/Hayward Gallery.\nAfter the Hayward exhibition, Mr. Gursky said he planned to stop teaching at the Düsseldorf academy, take a two-year sabbatical to travel the world, and spend more time in Ibiza, Spain, where his friends live and where he’ll be able to hear a lot of techno. Whatever he does next, Mr. Gursky will stand out as a maker of images, said Udo Kittelmann, the director of the National Gallery in Berlin and the curator of a Gursky show at the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden-Baden in 2015. A painter’s work is usually fairly recognizable, Mr. Kittelmann explained. “In photography, it’s much, much harder.” “It’s quite surprising that a photographer found a special handwriting in photography, that there is no misunderstanding,” Mr. Kittelmann added. “A Gursky is a Gursky.”.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story \n", "label": [[7, 21, "ARTIST"], [177, 191, "ARTIST"], [224, 230, "GPE"], [290, 305, "GALLERY"], [537, 550, "DATE"], [552, 558, "GPE"], [685, 692, "GPE"], [699, 703, "DATE"], [960, 974, "ARTIST"], [1055, 1061, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1064, 1068, "DATE"], [1160, 1175, "GALLERY"], [1214, 1221, "DATE"], [1288, 1293, "DATE"], [1315, 1323, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1417, 1429, "MONEY"], [1433, 1437, "DATE"], [1449, 1463, "ARTIST"], [1465, 1469, "DATE"], [1500, 1508, "GPE"], [1525, 1529, "GPE"], [1551, 1561, "ARTIST"], [1615, 1619, "DATE"], [1655, 1663, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1675, 1687, "MONEY"], [1693, 1700, "GALLERY"], [1743, 1749, "ARTIST"], [1765, 1770, "DATE"], [1774, 1783, "GPE"], [1784, 1789, "GPE"], [1812, 1819, "ESTIMATE"], [1997, 2009, "DATE"], [2011, 2021, "ARTIST"], [2273, 2280, "GALLERY"], [2301, 2311, "ARTIST"], [2537, 2548, "DATE"], [2739, 2749, "ARTIST"], [3011, 3018, "GALLERY"], [3030, 3042, "CURATOR"], [3099, 3119, "EVENT"], [3150, 3157, "GALLERY"], [3163, 3173, "ARTIST"], [3255, 3265, "CURATOR"], [3277, 3283, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3290, 3302, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3305, 3309, "DATE"], [3449, 3461, "DATE"], [3473, 3483, "ARTIST"], [3492, 3502, "CURATOR"], [3654, 3664, "CURATOR"], [3773, 3782, "ARTIST"], [3824, 3839, "GALLERY"], [3852, 3856, "DATE"], [4220, 4230, "ARTIST"], [4247, 4260, "CURATOR"], [4302, 4322, "MUSEUM"], [4326, 4334, "GPE"], [4343, 4353, "ARTIST"], [4373, 4377, "DATE"], [4457, 4460, "DATE"], [4531, 4541, "ARTIST"], [4724, 4733, "CURATOR"], [4800, 4811, "ARTIST"], [4912, 4921, "CURATOR"], [4979, 4989, "ARTIST"], [5002, 5009, "GPE"], [5019, 5031, "GPE"], [5130, 5140, "GPE"], [5385, 5390, "GPE"], [5451, 5455, "DATE"], [5536, 5548, "ARTIST"], [5574, 5587, "ARTIST"], [5589, 5600, "ARTIST"], [5602, 5615, "ARTIST"], [5679, 5689, "ARTIST"], [5836, 5841, "DATE"], [5842, 5846, "DATE"], [5855, 5865, "ARTIST"], [6201, 6211, "CURATOR"], [6355, 6365, "ARTIST"], [6465, 6470, "DATE"], [6621, 6631, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [6644, 6651, "GALLERY"], [6757, 6766, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6769, 6773, "DATE"], [6776, 6783, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6786, 6790, "DATE"], [6797, 6803, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6806, 6810, "DATE"], [6822, 6836, "ARTIST"], [6838, 6842, "DATE"], [6873, 6881, "GPE"], [6895, 6910, "GALLERY"], [6912, 6922, "ARTIST"], [7041, 7045, "DATE"], [7080, 7084, "DATE"], [7112, 7123, "ARTIST"], [7173, 7179, "ARTIST"], [7242, 7248, "GPE"], [7333, 7355, "DATE"], [7357, 7367, "ARTIST"], [7495, 7503, "WORK_OF_ART"], [7506, 7510, "DATE"], [7603, 7617, "ARTIST"], [7621, 7635, "ARTIST"], [7637, 7647, "ARTIST"], [7706, 7716, "ARTIST"], [7795, 7801, "WORK_OF_ART"], [7804, 7808, "DATE"], [7845, 7852, "GPE"], [8000, 8006, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8009, 8013, "DATE"], [8015, 8025, "ARTIST"], [8061, 8068, "GPE"], [8090, 8104, "ARTIST"], [8106, 8110, "DATE"], [8141, 8149, "GPE"], [8166, 8170, "GPE"], [8192, 8202, "ARTIST"], [8467, 8470, "DATE"], [8618, 8628, "ARTIST"], [8841, 8851, "GPE"], [9241, 9251, "ARTIST"], [9375, 9388, "DATE"], [9571, 9581, "ARTIST"], [9647, 9650, "DATE"], [9708, 9726, "WORK_OF_ART"], [9730, 9734, "DATE"], [9849, 9864, "GALLERY"], [9876, 9890, "ARTIST"], [9892, 9896, "DATE"], [9927, 9935, "GPE"], [9949, 9964, "GALLERY"], [9976, 9983, "GALLERY"], [9996, 10006, "ARTIST"], [10047, 10057, "GPE"], [10078, 10082, "DATE"], [10138, 10150, "GPE"], [10247, 10257, "ARTIST"], [10300, 10314, "CURATOR"], [10336, 10352, "GALLERY"], [10356, 10362, "GPE"], [10384, 10390, "ARTIST"], [10403, 10423, "MUSEUM"], [10427, 10438, "GPE"], [10442, 10446, "DATE"], [10497, 10511, "CURATOR"], [10688, 10702, "CURATOR"], [10713, 10719, "ARTIST"], [10725, 10731, "ARTIST"]]}

Share using Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Linkedin.\nBy Jason Farago 6th November 2015.\nAndreas Gurksy’s monumental photographs fill the viewer with awe – but are huge works like his still relevant in the age of the smartphone camera? Jason Farago thinks not. Y You almost never see human figures in the work of the German photographer Andreas Gursky. Or if you do, they’re more stick figures than individuals. Whether in a Pyongyang stadium or a Kuwaiti financial center, a Swiss mountain resort or a Vietnamese sweatshop, human beings appear as interchangeable specks within awesome, expansive terrains, sometimes natural but more often manmade. Individuals get lost in Gursky’s photographs – lost in the economic bulk of his stock exchanges and apartment blocks, and lost in the expanse of the images themselves, some of which are larger than the side of a minivan.\n Gursky stands in front of Rückblick, his new work that uses digital technology to bring together all of Germany’s living chancellors (Credit: EPA/Uli Deck/Corbis) It’s unclear whether Gursky’s images belong to the future or the past This autumn the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden-Baden opened a major exhibition of Gursky’s photography – the third in less than a decade, after a 2007 outing in Munich and a 2012 one in his hometown of Düsseldorf. This new show, organised Udo Kittelmann, the director of Berlin’s Nationalgalerie, in collaboration with the artist, features 34 of his large-scale photographs, including new works. It follows on the heels of a calamitous American retrospective, at the Parrish Museum of Art in the Hamptons, which drew hackles for its poor hang and exiguous argument. The Baden show promises is a more serious affair. But a lot has changed since Gursky and his fellow German photographers stormed onto the international art scene, and it’s unclear whether Gursky’s images belong to the future or the past. School photos Andreas Gursky was born in 1955 in Leipzig, came to West Germany as a child, and rose to prominence as a photographer in the late 1980s and early 1990s – not, it must be said, on his own. He emerged alongside a pair of other young photographers: Thomas Struth and Thomas Ruff, who had studied alongside Gursky at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. It was, and is, an august art school, where Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter, and Sigmar Polke had taught or studied in decades past.\n Gursky travelled to Pyongyang in 2007 to capture the Arirang festival, an annual massed remembrance of Kim Il Sung (Credit: Andreas Gursky/VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2015/Sprüth Magers) When Gursky arrived, and photography department was led by the married artists Bernd and Hilla Becher. (Hilla Becher died this October, at the age of 81; Bernd lived until 2007.) The Bechers, over nearly 50 years, documented the water towers, coal bunkers, and other industrial architecture of Germany’s Ruhr Valley, shot in black-and-white with rigorously objectivity and displayed in systematic sequences. Sentiment and expressiveness were out of the question, and humans were nowhere to be found. Large color photographs decorate; small black-and-white photographs don't – Susan Kismaric The Bechers’ students formed what became known as the Düsseldorf School – each of them applying, in their own way, the lessons of the Bechers. Gursky, after a series of early landscapes, began to depict the nodes and epicenters of the fast-changing global economy, whether a Prada store, a Shanghai hotel, or a Chicago stock exchange: all photographed at a chilly, Becherian remove. Struth shot tourists in museums and carefully posed families; Ruff made clinical portraits. In the late 1990s, the three even got the unlovely nickname ‘Struffsky’, a portmanteau of their names that unfairly suggested they were interchangeable. Rhine II – one of a set of six pictures of the river – became the most expensive photo ever sold when it went under the hammer in 2007 (Credit: WENN Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo) Standing at a slight distance was a fourth Becher student, Candida Höfer, known for her sober images of libraries and opera houses. Other students of the Bechers achieved less fame but exhibited similar dispassion, among them Elger Esser, Jörg Sasse, Axel Hütte, and Simone Nieweg. Gursky and his fellow-travelers came of age at a critical moment in the history of photography, for two reasons. First, photography’s status in the art world was undergoing a critical shift in appraisal when Gursky began to exhibit in the late 80s and early 90s. Once only partially accepted as an artistic medium, it blossomed into a discipline as important, and increasingly as expensive, as painting or sculpture. Second, new digital technologies for making, editing, and printing images were offering photographers entirely new ways to work. Gursky, even more than Struth and Ruff, began to print his images at gargantuan scale. His 1999 panorama of the Rhine, at $4.3m (then £2.7m) the most expensive photo ever sold at auction, measures three and a half meters wide. (Without doubting Gursky’s motives, we might remember the observation of MoMA photography curator Susan Kismaric on why photography got supersized during the last economic boom: “Large color photographs decorate; small black-and-white photographs don't decorate.”).\nParis, Montparnasse from 1993 grafts multiple images of a housing estate into a vast panorama (Credit: Andreas Gursky/VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2015/Sprüth Magers) He also began to employ digital manipulation, first sparingly, then wildly. Gursky embraced digital manipulation early: in his 1993 photograph of Paris’s giant Mouchotte tower block, multiple images are grafted together in postproduction to produce a single overwhelming panorama. (Ruff went digital too, with calamitous results – see, or rather don’t, his woozy manipulation of porn images – whereas Höfer and Struth continue to eschew digital trickery.) Soon he was lost in it, and eschewing the camera for the computer. His 2001 Stockholder Meeting was fashioned from dozens of standalone images, and recent Google Earth-style epics are fashioned out of satellite imagery. He has kept it up. At his retrospective in Baden-Baden, Gursky is displaying a head-scratching new photograph in which we see Barnett Newman’s 1950–51 painting Vir Heroicus Sublimis, in front of which sit Germany’s four living chancellors: a pomaded Gerhard Schröder, round-shouldered Helmut Kohl, canary-clad Angela Merkel, and even 96-year-old Helmut Schmidt with his ubiquitous cigarette. This picture, called Rückblick or ‘Retrospect’, has that rarest thing in Gursky’s work: recognisable humans. But if you thought Gursky had rounded up the chancellors on his own, think again; the whole thing is a mock-up in the vein of Stalinist photomontage, and Newman’s painting is where it always is, on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. New focus On the occasion of Gursky’s MoMA retrospective in 2001, the New York Times critic Michael Kimmelman celebrated the “sheer awe” of his photographs, but then slightly tempered his praise. “Will these pictures,” he asked, “seem as astonishing to a future generation accustomed to spiffier technologies?” It was a prescient question. And I suspect we can answer it with no – at least if the work of younger artists and curators is any guide.\n The workers weaving cane in Gursky’s Nha Trang (2004) appear as mere specks when viewed from a distance (Credit: Andreas Gursky/VG Bild-Kunst/Sprüth Magers) Social media has obviated the need for anyone to print an image at all At the turn of the millennium, photography’s future seemed to be one of higher and higher resolution and more and more exact digital editing tools, such that all artists – maybe even all consumers – could aspire to the grandeur of 18th-Century history painting. Instead, cameras were absorbed into our phones, and social media obviated the need for anyone to print an image at all. (When was the last time you printed a photograph: six years ago?) The importance of photographs today, for artists as much as for laypeople, derives less from their quality than from their ability to circulate and transmit information and appearances, and the kinds of images that do so are diametrically opposed to Gurskyian grandeur. In the words of another German artist, Hito Steyerl, the image of our time is not the super-slick panorama, but “the poor image… uploaded, downloaded, shared, reformatted, and reedited. It transforms quality into accessibility.” Bahrain I shows the country’s Formula 1 racing track photographed from above and manipulated into a beguiling pattern (Andreas Gursky/VG Bild-Kunst/Sprüth Magers) Gursky is now 60. He has earned a degree of deference. One could imagine that a student of the conceptually sophisticated Bechers would be thinking about much more than the subject matter of his photography – that he would also care about how viewers see them, how they are reproduced, how they are transmitted. But unlike other photographers of his generation, such Jeff Wall and Cindy Sherman, Gursky has shown no interest over the last decade in rethinking his practice, and if anything he has doubled down on opulence and awe. (He also relies on heavy doses of copyright protection.) That’s especially clear when you look at his recent photographs made from pre-existing imagery, such as the giant satellite images and the cheesy, cynical chancellor portrait. They suggest that, unlike some of his Düsseldorf colleagues and despite his early gaze on stock markets and sweatshops, Gursky was never too engaged with the world as it is. As images keep getting faster and smaller, what he has always cared most about is bigness for its own sake.

The resulting pictures have a formal congruence deriving from a bold and edgy dialogue between photography and painting, empirical observation and artfulness, conceptual rigor and spontaneity, representation and abstraction. Grappling with the abstract aesthetic structures that underlie manmade or natural environments, and reconstructing real subjects according to his inner eye, Gursky presents a world view that fuses the flux of life and nature with the stillness of metaphysical reflection. Andreas Gursky was born in 1955 in Leipzig, former East Germany. He attended Folkwangschule, Essen, from 1978 to 1981, and Staatliche Kunstakademie, Düsseldorf, from 1981 to 1987. Gurksy has had numerous major museum exhibitions including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Kunstmuseum Basel, Switzerland, “Retrospective 1984–2007,” Haus der Kunst, Munich, Istanbul Museum of Modern Art, Turkey, Sharjah Art Museum, United Arab Emirates, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, The National Art Center, Tokyo, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf, and his work is featured in important public and private collections throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Tate Modern, London, National Galleries of Art, Edinburgh, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Kunsthaus Zürich, Switzerland, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, California, Kunstmuseum Basel, Switzerland, Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, California, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, and Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf. Gursky currently lives and works in Düsseldorf, Germany.

Shanghai , 2000. Photography. Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía Collection, Madrid.\nAndreas Gursky (Leipzig, Germany, 1955) is one of the most renowned German photographers today. Proof of his recognition is this exhibition at the Palacio de Velázquez which comes from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the first retrospective in this museum of a German artist from his generation. A student of Otto Steinert during his years living in Essen and of Bern Becher during his formative training in the Düsseldorf Kunstakademie, the inventor of subjective photography Gursky would be shaped by the influence of artistic experimentation that Joseph Beuys encourages at his school when he was appointed professor of sculpture in 1961. The German photographer adds to the avant-garde environment at Düsseldorf-Cologne his own original experience, which he gains at his family business where he becomes familiar with, from a very young age, commercial photography. Contact with Henri Cartier-Bresson’s style during the Seventies, when the proliferation of galleries, museum programmes and publications supported photographic creation and the influence of the appearance of American photographers such as Dan Graham, the Canadian Jeff Wall, the German Jochen Gerz and Frenchman Jean Le Gac in the Eighties, all helped create his unique style based on large formats, simplicity, composition rigour and colour sophistication as well as an on-going dialogue with the history of painting. It is in his exterior photographs, those that depict mountain sceneries, waterfalls and highways, where you can appreciate the immensity of the environment in contrast to the smallness of what is human. Some examples from this exhibition are Klausenpass, (1984); Seilbahn, Dolomiten, (1987); Aletschgletscher (Aletsch glaciar), (1993); Niagara Falls, (1989) and Autobahn, Bremen, (1991). Repetition plays a very important role in Gursky’s work. In his photos there are often accumulations of similar objects, which, despite the apparent complexity, maintain an implicit order. The outdoor storage of cars that are features in Salerno, (1990), the worktables of factory workers in Siemens, Karlsruhe, (1991), the cars waiting to board a ferry in Genoa, (1991), the thousands of books on the shelves of Bibliothek, (1999) or the products lining the shelves of a supermarket in 99 cent (1999) remind us of the characteristics of a globalised world and document a lifestyle based on photographic constructions like in Prada I, (1996) which depicts a shoe display from a store, a vision created with a computer by Gursky himself, who incorporates into his photographic technique the advantages of technological advances in the photographic process. Digital Manipulation serves Gursky to create an invented world in which the spectator of his photographs immediately recognises himself. This exhibition, from 1984 until today, allows for an appreciation of geometry in Gursky’s images. The diagonal of the bridge and the fenced land behave like two converging lines that cross the composition in Ruhrtal (1989) and in Breitscheider Kreuz, (1990) where geometry is imposed again. These compositions contrast with those entropic ones from the Tokyo Stock Exchange or different raves which show crowds of hundreds of people. Finally this exhibition makes patent Gursky’s interest to immortalise the usual dynamics of sporting events such as a football match, in Zürich I (1985), group swimming in Neujahrsschwimmer (New Year's Day Swimmers), (1988), a mountain descent in Albertville, (1992), the horse races at Sha Tin, (1994) or the boxing in Klitschko, (1999).\n Exhibition´s details Organized by: The Museum of Modern Art, Nueva York, in collaboration with Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía.\nCuratorship: Peter Galassi.\nExhibition Tour: The Museum of Modern Art, New York (March 4 - May 15, 2001).\nArtists: Andreas Gursky.\nRelated Collection artworks included in the exhibition Reina Sofia Museum's Publications.\nCollection artworks included in the exhibition Andreas Gursky Shanghai 2000.\nReina Sofia Museum's Publications Andreas Gursky.\nCurrent exhibitions 8 April – 4 September 2022 Carlos Bunga Against the Extravagance of Desire.\n23 March – 29 August 2022 From Posada to Isotype, from Kollwitz to Catlett Exchanges of Political Print Culture.

{"id": 218, "data": "Skip to main content  In recent years, Andreas Gursky has spoken of his affinity with painting, even of a slight frustration with the limitations of photography. ‘I’m a bit jealous of painting, where you have surface and the smell of paint. In my case, it is always the same,’ he told a reporter for Canadian Art in 2009. With his ‘Ocean’ series (2009–10), he introduced, paradoxically, both radical distance and subjectivity by combining found imagery with large photoshopped bodies of water in the same image. The found (represented by the satellite images of landmasses situated along the edges of the composition) and the photoshopped (exemplified by the imaginatively invented water currents) constitute the two diametrically opposed poles toward which his work might move. The use of satellite images complicates the question of authorship, as Norman Bryson explains in the 2010 catalogue for the ‘Oceans’ exhibition at Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles, because the scale of the images and the scale of technology needed to create them are both at issue. If his previous works did not appear to have been made from an individual point of view – an effect constructed by fusing composite photographic images together digitally to create an essential truth – ‘Ocean’ literalizes this notion of authorlessness. At the same time, with the addition of vast expanses of water and imaginary coastlines that appear believable but are created entirely in Photoshop, the series undercut the idea of objectivity. Along with ‘Ocean’, this exhibition included a new series ‘Bangkok’ (2011), which takes the more subjective approach further. While the fictitious sections of the ‘Ocean’ pieces remain within the constraints of a certain verisimilitude – informed by empirical data about currents – the watery surfaces of the ‘Bangkok’ pieces do away with this positivist premise. Although the name of the series and the fact that they were taken of the Chao Phraya River supply a geographical reference point, these images of what appears to be water are curiously unspecific. Light reflected on the surface illuminates the waves and renders the water visible. In Bangkok V, the reflections create vertical strips that bifurcate the image – like a Barnett Newman zip painting with a bit of Clyfford Still’s jaggedness – finally making explicit Gursky’s previously stated affinity with the medium of painting. In other works, such as Bangkok II, various colours have been digitally added to the areas of reflected light. In still others, these areas are emptied of colour entirely and delineated by schematic lines. Small details of objects and plants floating in the water are added here and there and act as a kind of narrative subtext. These additions contradict the presumption of verisimilitude because they look either too blurry, almost painterly, or too sharply delineated in relation to the surrounding water. The differences in scale of this incidental floating debris and the arbitrariness of their inclusion jar the appearance of seamlessness that has been one of the strengths of Gursky’s oeuvre. In previous works, spectators could marvel at the detail, then step back in order to behold the entire image. Even though the effect of a seamless whole was equally deceptive in earlier works such as 99 Cent II Diptychon (1999) or Hamm, Bergwerk Ost (Hamm, East Mine, 2008), the iconographic systems Gursky constructed held tight. Without an overarching structure, the introduction of images of debris and floating flora in varying resolution and scale appears willful and the narrative artificial. The pictures of shimmering, wavy surfaces, at times quite obviously distorted by digital manipulation, appear to be pushing the very limits of photography that Gursky bemoans: His images court the painterly but must remain within the printed two-dimensional restrictions of the photographic. If one considers Gursky’s long-standing iconographic flirtation with abstract painting – for example the horizontal lines of asparagus farming in Beelitz (2007) or the curvy details of a Formula One circuit in Bahrain II (2007) – this development is not surprising. Clearly, these photographs want to be something else.\n I ISABELLE MOFFAT.\nSHARE THIS.\nMORE LIKE THIS Features ,.\nProfiles.\nWhat Does Identity Mean to Maria Eichhorn?

In these new works, Gursky demonstrates that a photographer can make or construct--rather than simply take--photographs about modern life and produce them on the scale of epic painting. Just as history painters of previous centuries found their subjects in the realities of everyday life, he seeks inspiration in his observations of the human species in the world, whether firsthand or via reports of global phenomena in the daily media. The resulting pictures have a formal congruence deriving from a bold and edgy dialogue between photography and painting, empirical observation and artfulness, conceptual rigor and spontaneity, representation and abstraction. In pursuit of his aim to create \"an encyclopedia of life\" Gursky's world view fuses the flux of reality with the stillness of metaphysical reflection.  From initially using the computer as a retouching tool, he began exploring its transformative potential, sometimes combining elements of multiple shots of the same subject into an intricate yet seamless whole, at other times barely altering the image at all. Over time his subjects have expanded to map and distill the emergent patterns and symmetries of a globalized world with its consensual flows and grids of data and people, architecture, and mass spectacle. In the new Ocean series, with their darkly nuanced surfaces, Gursky has worked to reconcile the division between the machine eye and the human eye, continuing the debates and practices begun in the nineteenth century regarding photography and the issue of artistic expression versus objective science. Art historian Norman Bryson has been published widely in the areas of eighteenth-century art history, critical theory, and contemporary art. Werner Spies is an art historian and curator. He was one of Andreas Gursky’s mentors during the artist’s years at the Düsseldorf Academy.  Andreas Gursky was born in 1955 in Leipzig, former East Germany. He attended Folkwangschule, Essen (1978-1981) and Staatliche Kunstakademie, Düsseldorf (1981-1987). Recent major museum exhibitions include \"Werke-Works 80-08\", Kunstmuseen Krefeld (2008, touring to Moderna Museet, Stockholm and Vancouver Art Gallery in 2009); Kunstmuseum Basel, Switzerland (2007); Haus der Kunst, Munich (2007, touring to Istanbul Museum of Modern Art, Sharjah Art Museum, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and Ekaterina Foundation, Moscow in 2007-2008); The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2001, touring to Reina Sofia, Madrid, Centre Pompidou, Paris, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 2001-2002). His work is included in important public and private collections throughout the world.

As one of the most coveted photographers working today, Gursky visualises the unimaginable scale of modernity with photographs that pin you in front of them. Early Life.\nBorn in east Germany to a family of photographers, Andreas Gursky grew up and studied in Essen and Düsseldorf whose respective photography scenes had a profound impact on his work. In Essen, Gursky first developed his technical skill, studying visual communication under key 20th-century German documentary photographers Otto Steinhart and Michael Schmidt from 1978 to 1981. From there he moved to the Düsseldorf Art Academy, an internationally renowned mecca of contemporary photography led by legendary German conceptual artists, Bernd and Hilla Becher. Between 1976-98 their photography department produced generations of Germany’s most acclaimed artists – Gursky alone counted Axel Hütte, Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff and Gerhard Richter among his peers.\n Andreas Gursky, The Rhine II, 1999, courtesy the artist,  © Andreas Gursky.\nBecher Influence Bernd and Hilla Becher were not only visionary teachers, but groundbreaking artists in their own right who, prior to opening the Academy, had been the first photographers to claim the label of ‘artist’ with their typology series of disappearing industrial architecture in the Ruhr. Gursky embraced these aesthetics, and under the Becher’s guidance, pushed it to broaden the boundaries of photography himself. Like so many of the Becher’s students, Gursky blurs the idea of photographs as truthful representations. Though he only began digitally manipulating images in the early 90s (after Ruff had already done so), it is a defining feature of his work that subverts the traditional role of photographer. Gursky’s images therefore straddle both photography and art, referencing the visual language of painting – its techniques and compositions – while experimenting within a digital framework.\n Andreas Gursky, Klausen Pass, 1984, courtesy the artist, © Andreas Gursky Later Work and Stardom.\nGursky initially echoed the style of Bernd and Hiller Becher with small, black and white prints, but by the mid-80s he was beginning to grapple with an epic scale that has since come to define his work. This initially manifested in images of people hiking, swimming and skiing while dwarfed by their surroundings (Klausen Pass, 1984), drawing on a sense of sublime that became a central motif for him. Things really changed in 1990 with Salerno I, the moment Gursky began digitally manipulating his photographs. This scarcely conceivable image of the Neapolitan port city and its surrounding mountains operates on a kind of epic scale best associated with 19th-century landscape painters. Juxtaposing size with detail: the multi-colour cargo awaiting transit, the bustling port and miniature houses, each section of the photograph offers up its own depth that demands hours of individual inspection. This is a constant for Gursky, whose photographs hover between micro and macro both in terms of perspective: the enormous image with microscopic detail, and theme: the local place that reveals a universal zeitgeist of modernity.\n Andreas Gursky, Salerno I, 1990, courtesy the artist, © Andreas Gursky.\nFrom that point, Gursky began producing large-scale, high-resolution images that explored the scale of man-made creations while largely omitting people. Airports, supermarkets, apartment buildings, mass gatherings in North Korea, rivers, oceans, stock exchanges and landfills all drew Gursky’s attention, not only for their size (Gursky always photographs from a distance, sometimes via helicopter), but for what they reveal about globalisation, capitalism and human consumption. Despite maintaining his photographs carry no explicit political message, they are bound by this fascination with perspective and scale, not just in terms of physical size (his photographs are often more than 2m), but the industrial forces they depict and what they say about modern civilisation.\n Andreas Gursky  Pyongyang II, Diptychon, 2007, courtesy the artist, © Andreas Gursky.\n99 Cent (1999) There’s something ironic about Gursky’s photographs of cheap, mass-produced goods breaking the record for the most expensive photograph sold at auction (for $3.34 million in 2007). Taken at a 99 cents store in LA, the photograph is an explosion of colour and minute detail which, like so many Gursky works, is initially difficult to distinguish. It’s only once the eye adjusts that the colour is revealed as packaging, and familiar brands stacked on endless aisles become visible.\n Andreas Gursky, 99 Cent, 1999, courtesy the artists, © Andreas Gursky The hyper-real detail and information overload are common elements for Gursky, along with the unusual perspective of the image, which, in the words of Danish curator Frederik Stjernflet, gives the impression of being, “seen from nowhere”. This hypnotic quality gives, “the strange experience of an excess of recorded detail far beyond the point where the viewer’s attention is focused at any single moment.” In its linear composition and enormous size (measuring over 6×11 foot), the photograph more closely resembles a work of abstract expressionism, yet the scene is banal and could likely be anywhere in the world. That’s the point. With its almost claustrophobic sense of excess and saccharine, ‘pick me’ colours, 99 cent distills the age of globalised consumerism in a single image. Some consider it a biting statement on capitalism and material greed, while others think it’s simply Gursky’s aptitude for finding art in the everyday.\n Top image: Andreas Gursky, Salerno I, 1990,

{"id": 226, "data": "Andreas Gursky From 9 September, the Küppersmühle Museum will present around 60 photographs from four decades, starting with early works from the Ruhr region, which often served as a setting for Andreas Gursky during his studies with Bernd and Hilla Becher at the Düsseldorf Academy. The rest of the exhibition tour ranges from well-known iconographic works to new works in large format and provides a comprehensive introduction to the visual cosmos of the photo artist. 09 September 2021 until 30 January 2022\nMKM Museum Küppersmühle for Modern Art, Duisburg  Andreas Gursky (*1955) is one of the most renowned contemporary photographers worldwide. His works have a special object language that critically addresses diverse social issues and current topics. His distanced and subjective view of everyday cultural phenomena, consumerism, globalisation, environment, climate, economy and politics makes him a unique observer of our time. Numerous details and structures of complex systems are revealed in his works and invite us to approach the “bigger picture” in the play of proximity and distance. MKM director Walter Smerling curated the exhibition in close collaboration with Andreas Gursky. The artist has designed the retrospective explicitly for the location, with close references to the region. _______ ACCOMPANYING PROGRAMME KUMI – THE ART WEEK | every Wednesday | 3.00 p.m. Every Wednesday, an art educator will guide you through the exhibition ANDREAS GURSKY.

It is the largest museum in North America dedicated to a single artist.[4]  The museum holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives from the Pittsburgh-born pop art icon Andy Warhol. The Andy Warhol Museum is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and is a collaborative project of the Carnegie Institute, the Dia Art Foundation and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (AWFVA).[5] Warhol Self Portrait Exhibit in 2010 The museum is located in an 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) facility on seven floors.  Containing 17 galleries, the museum features 900 paintings, close to 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and over 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Its most recent operating budget (2010) was $6.1 million.  In addition to its Pittsburgh location the museum has sponsored 56 traveling exhibits that have attracted close to nine million visitors in 153 venues worldwide since 1996.[6] Contents 1 History.\n2 Fictional portrayals.\n3 See also.\n4 References.\n5 External links.\nHistory[edit] Plans for the museum were announced in October 1989,[7] about 2½ years after Warhol's death.  At the time of the announcement, works worth an estimated $80 million were donated to the newly announced museum by the AWFVA and the Dia Art Foundation.[7] Thomas N. Armstrong III, who had been the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1974 to 1990, was named the museum's first director in 1993.[8] Matt Wrbican joined the staff of the museum before it opened, inventorying Warhol's belongings in New York, and has become the archivist and an expert on Warhol's work.[9] By 1993, the 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) industrial warehouse and its extensive renovations had cost about $12 million, and the AWFVA had donated more than 1,000 of Warhol's works worth over $55 million,[8] a donation that grew to about 3,000 works.[4] On May 13–14, 1994, the museum attracted about 25,000 visitors to its opening weekend.[4]  Armstrong, its founding director, resigned nine months after its opening; at the time of his resignation, the museum had had \"tense relations\" with the AWFVA and the Carnegie Institute, its financial backer, though The New York Times could find no one involved who would say whether that friction played a role in Armstrong's resignation.[4] On November 1, 1997, the AWFVA donated all Warhol film and video copyrights to the museum.[10] In 2013, it was announced that in Manhattan, New York City, in the Essex Crossing development on the Lower East Side, an annex to the main Pittsburgh museum was scheduled to open by 2017.[11][12][13][14]\n[15] However, the museum announced in March 2015 that it had dropped its plans to open the New York annex.[16] In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Lou Reed, based on Warhol's 1975 book, “The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again”, was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the museum in Pittsburgh.[17] Fictional portrayals[edit] Display of Interview magazine.\ncovers.\nThe 2010 film She's Out of My League filmed a key scene at the museum during an evening event.

One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony.[3] It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.[2][3] Amongst the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Ray Johnson. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of abstract expressionism, as well as an expansion of those ideas.[4] Due to its utilization of found objects and images, it is similar to Dada. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art, or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.[5] Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of Campbell's Soup Cans, by Andy Warhol. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by Warhol's Campbell's Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (pictured).

They used impersonal, mundane reality, irony, and parody to \"defuse\" the personal symbolism and \"painterly looseness\" of abstract expressionism.[4][6] In the U.S., some artwork by Larry Rivers, Alex Katz and Man Ray anticipated pop art.[7] By contrast, the origins of pop art in post-War Britain, while employing irony and parody, were more academic. Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American pop culture as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society.[6] Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by American popular culture when viewed from afar.[4]  Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of Dadaism.[4] While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture.[4] Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and Kurt Schwitters. Proto-pop[edit] Although both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, Marcel Duchamp and others in Europe like Francis Picabia and Man Ray predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American proto-pop origins which utilized \"as found\" cultural objects.[4] During the 1920s, American artists Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy, Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis created paintings that contained pop culture imagery (mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design), almost \"prefiguring\" the pop art movement.[8][9] United Kingdom: the Independent Group[edit] Richard Hamilton 's collage Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? (1956) is one of the earliest works to be considered \"pop art\".\n The Independent Group (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement.[2][10] They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging prevailing modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of fine art. Their group discussions centered on pop culture implications from elements such as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology. At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi presented a lecture using a series of collages titled Bunk! that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947 and 1949.[2][10] This material of \"found objects\" such as advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics mostly represented American popular culture. One of the collages in that presentation was Paolozzi's I was a Rich Man's Plaything (1947), which includes the first use of the word \"pop\", appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver.[2][11] Following Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused primarily on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.[6] According to the son of John McHale, the term \"pop art\" was first coined by his father in 1954 in conversation with Frank Cordell,[12] although other sources credit its origin to British critic Lawrence Alloway.[13][14] (Both versions agree that the term was used in Independent Group discussions by mid-1955.) \"Pop art\" as a moniker was then used in discussions by IG members in the Second Session of the IG in 1955, and the specific term \"pop art\" first appeared in published print in the article \"But Today We Collect Ads\" by IG members Alison and Peter Smithson in Ark magazine in 1956.[15] However, the term is often credited to British art critic/curator Lawrence Alloway for his 1958 essay titled The Arts and the Mass Media, even though the precise language he uses is \"popular mass culture\".[16] \"Furthermore, what I meant by it then is not what it means now. I used the term, and also 'Pop Culture' to refer to the products of the mass media, not to works of art that draw upon popular culture. In any case, sometime between the winter of 1954–55 and 1957 the phrase acquired currency in conversation...\"[17] Nevertheless, Alloway was one of the leading critics to defend the inclusion of the imagery of mass culture in the fine arts. Alloway clarified these terms in 1966, at which time Pop Art had already transited from art schools and small galleries to a major force in the artworld. But its success had not been in England. Practically simultaneously, and independently, New York City had become the hotbed for Pop Art.[17] In London, the annual Royal Society of British Artists (RBA) exhibition of young talent in 1960 first showed American pop influences. In January 1961, the most famous RBA-Young Contemporaries of all put David Hockney, the American R B Kitaj, New Zealander Billy Apple, Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Joe Tilson, Patrick Caulfield, Peter Phillips, Pauline Boty and Peter Blake on the map; Apple designed the posters and invitations for both the 1961 and 1962 Young Contemporaries exhibitions.[18] Hockney, Kitaj and Blake went on to win prizes at the John-Moores-Exhibition in Liverpool in the same year. Apple and Hockney traveled together to New York during the Royal College's 1961 summer break, which is when Apple first made contact with Andy Warhol – both later moved to the United States and Apple became involved with the New York pop art scene.[18] United States[edit] Although pop art began in the early 1950s, in America it was given its greatest impetus during the 1960s. The term \"pop art\" was officially introduced in December 1962; the occasion was a \"Symposium on Pop Art\" organized by the Museum of Modern Art.[19] By this time, American advertising had adopted many elements of modern art and functioned at a very sophisticated level. Consequently, American artists had to search deeper for dramatic styles that would distance art from the well-designed and clever commercial materials.[6] As the British viewed American popular culture imagery from a somewhat removed perspective, their views were often instilled with romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones. By contrast, American artists, bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, produced work that was generally more bold and aggressive.[10] Roy Lichtenstein , Drowning Girl , 1963, on display at the Museum of Modern Art, New York .\n According to historian, curator and critic Henry Geldzahler, \"Ray Johnson's collages Elvis Presley No. 1 and James Dean stand as the Plymouth Rock of the Pop movement.\"[20] Author Lucy Lippard wrote that \"The Elvis ... and Marilyn Monroe [collages] ... heralded Warholian Pop.\"[21] Johnson worked as a graphic designer, met Andy Warhol by 1956 and both designed several book covers for New Directions and other publishers. Johnson began mailing out whimsical flyers advertising his design services printed via offset lithography. He later became known as the father of mail art as the founder of his \"New York Correspondence School,\" working small by stuffing clippings and drawings into envelopes rather than working larger like his contemporaries.[22] A note about the cover image in January 1958's Art News pointed out that \"[Jasper] Johns' first one-man show ... places him with such better-known colleagues as Rauschenberg, Twombly, Kaprow and Ray Johnson\".[23] Indeed, two other important artists in the establishment of America's pop art vocabulary were the painters Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg.[10] Rauschenberg, who like Ray Johnson attended Black Mountain College in North Carolina after World War II, was influenced by the earlier work of Kurt Schwitters and other Dada artists, and his belief that \"painting relates to both art and life\" challenged the dominant modernist perspective of his time.[24] His use of discarded readymade objects (in his Combines) and pop culture imagery (in his silkscreen paintings) connected his works to topical events in everyday America.[10][25][26] The silkscreen paintings of 1962–64 combined expressive brushwork with silkscreened magazine clippings from Life, Newsweek, and National Geographic. Johns' paintings of flags, targets, numbers, and maps of the U.S. as well three-dimensional depictions of ale cans drew attention to questions of representation in art.[27] Johns' and Rauschenberg's work of the 1950s is frequently referred to as Neo-Dada, and is visually distinct from the prototypical American pop art which exploded in the early 1960s.[28][29] Roy Lichtenstein is of equal importance to American pop art. His work, and its use of parody, probably defines the basic premise of pop art better than any other.[10] Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint in his best known works, such as Drowning Girl (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' Secret Hearts #83. (Drowning Girl is part of the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.)[30] His work features thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein said, \"[abstract expressionists] put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's.\"[31] Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery/content into the mix. The paintings of Lichtenstein, like those of Andy Warhol, Tom Wesselmann and others, share a direct attachment to the commonplace image of American popular culture, but also treat the subject in an impersonal manner clearly illustrating the idealization of mass production.[10] Andy Warhol is probably the most famous figure in pop art. In fact, art critic Arthur Danto once called Warhol \"the nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced\".[19]  Warhol attempted to take pop beyond an artistic style to a life style, and his work often displays a lack of human affectation that dispenses with the irony and parody of many of his peers.[32][33] Early U.S. exhibitions[edit] The Cheddar Cheese canvas from Andy Warhol 's Campbell's Soup Cans , 1962.\n Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine and Tom Wesselmann had their first shows in the Judson Gallery in 1959 and 1960 and later in 1960 through 1964 along with James Rosenquist, George Segal and others at the Green Gallery on 57th Street in Manhattan. In 1960, Martha Jackson showed installations and assemblages, New Media – New Forms featured Hans Arp, Kurt Schwitters, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Jim Dine and May Wilson. 1961 was the year of Martha Jackson's spring show, Environments, Situations, Spaces.[34][35] Andy Warhol held his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in July 1962 at Irving Blum's Ferus Gallery, where he showed 32 paintings of Campell's soup cans, one for every flavor. Warhol sold the set of paintings to Blum for $1,000; in 1996, when the Museum of Modern Art acquired it, the set was valued at $15 million.[19] Donald Factor, the son of Max Factor Jr., and an art collector and co-editor of avant-garde literary magazine Nomad, wrote an essay in the magazine's last issue, Nomad/New York. The essay was one of the first on what would become known as pop art, though Factor did not use the term. The essay, \"Four Artists\", focused on Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg.[36] In the 1960s, Oldenburg, who became associated with the pop art movement, created many happenings, which were performance art-related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was \"Ray Gun Theater\". The cast of colleagues in his performances included: artists Lucas Samaras, Tom Wesselmann, Carolee Schneemann, Öyvind Fahlström and Richard Artschwager; dealer Annina Nosei; art critic Barbara Rose; and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer.[37] His first wife, Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with \"profound\" expressions or ideas. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's Lower East Side to house The Store, a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods.[37] Opening in 1962, Willem de Kooning's New York art dealer, the Sidney Janis Gallery, organized the groundbreaking International Exhibition of the New Realists, a survey of new-to-the-scene American, French, Swiss, Italian New Realism, and British pop art. The fifty-four artists shown included Richard Lindner, Wayne Thiebaud, Roy Lichtenstein (and his painting Blam), Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, Tom Wesselmann, George Segal, Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (The Love Wall from 1961), Öyvind Fahlström, Yves Klein, Arman, Daniel Spoerri, Christo and Mimmo Rotella. The show was seen by Europeans Martial Raysse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely in New York, who were stunned by the size and look of the American artwork. Also shown were Marisol, Mario Schifano, Enrico Baj and Öyvind Fahlström. Janis lost some of his abstract expressionist artists when Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and Philip Guston quit the gallery, but gained Dine, Oldenburg, Segal and Wesselmann.[38] At an opening-night soiree thrown by collector Burton Tremaine, Willem de Kooning appeared and was turned away by Tremaine, who ironically owned a number of de Kooning's works. Rosenquist recalled: \"at that moment I thought, something in the art world has definitely changed\".[19] Turning away a respected abstract artist proved that, as early as 1962, the pop art movement had begun to dominate art culture in New York. A bit earlier, on the West Coast, Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine and Andy Warhol from New York City; Phillip Hefferton and Robert Dowd from Detroit; Edward Ruscha and Joe Goode from Oklahoma City; and Wayne Thiebaud from California were included in the New Painting of Common Objects show. This first pop art museum exhibition in America was curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum.[39]  Pop art was ready to change the art world. New York followed Pasadena in 1963, when the Guggenheim Museum exhibited Six Painters and the Object, curated by Lawrence Alloway. The artists were Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol.[40] Another pivotal early exhibition was The American Supermarket organised by the Bianchini Gallery in 1964. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, including Apple, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Oldenburg, and Johns. This project was recreated in 2002 as part of the Tate Gallery's Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture.[41] By 1962, pop artists started exhibiting in commercial galleries in New York and Los Angeles; for some, it was their first commercial one-man show. The Ferus Gallery presented Andy Warhol in Los Angeles (and Ed Ruscha in 1963). In New York, the Green Gallery showed Rosenquist, Segal, Oldenburg, and Wesselmann. The Stable Gallery showed R. Indiana and Warhol (in his first New York show). The Leo Castelli Gallery presented Rauschenberg, Johns, and Lichtenstein. Martha Jackson showed Jim Dine and Allen Stone showed Wayne Thiebaud. By 1966, after the Green Gallery and the Ferus Gallery closed, the Leo Castelli Gallery represented Rosenquist, Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and Ruscha. The Sidney Janis Gallery represented Oldenburg, Segal, Dine, Wesselmann and Marisol, while Allen Stone continued to represent Thiebaud, and Martha Jackson continued representing Robert Indiana.[42] In 1968, the São Paulo 9 Exhibition – Environment U.S.A.: 1957–1967 featured the \"Who's Who\" of pop art. Considered as a summation of the classical phase of the American pop art period, the exhibit was curated by William Seitz. The artists were Edward Hopper, James Gill, Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol and Tom Wesselmann.[43] France[edit] Nouveau réalisme refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic Pierre Restany[44] and the artist Yves Klein during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the \"Constitutive Declaration of New Realism,\" in April 1960, proclaiming, \"Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real.\"[45] This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: Yves Klein, Arman, Martial Raysse, Pierre Restany, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and the Ultra-Lettrists, Francois Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Jacques de la Villeglé; in 1961 these were joined by César, Mimmo Rotella, then Niki de Saint Phalle and Gérard Deschamps. The artist Christo showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.[45] Contemporary of American Pop Art—often conceived as its transposition in France—new realism was along with Fluxus and other groups one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose Nice, on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the École de Nice [fr] movement.[46] In spite of the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct appropriation of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Restany; to a \"poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality\".[47] Spain[edit] In Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the \"new figurative\", which arose from the roots of the crisis of informalism. Eduardo Arroyo could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both mass media communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of \"pop\" art is Alfredo Alcaín, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions. Also in the category of Spanish pop art is the \"Chronicle Team\" (El Equipo Crónica), which existed in Valencia between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists Manolo Valdés and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as \"pop\" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. Filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar emerged from Madrid's \"La Movida\" subculture of the 1970s making low budget super 8 pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book Almodovar on Almodovar, he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film \"Funny Face\" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene. New Zealand[edit] Michel Tuffery 's Pisupo lua afe (Corned beef 2000) (1994).\nIn New Zealand, pop art has predominately flourished since the 1990s, and is often connected to Kiwiana. Kiwiana is a pop-centered, idealised representation of classically Kiwi icons, such as meat pies, kiwifruit, tractors, jandals, Four Square supermarkets; the inherent campness of this is often subverted to signify cultural messages.[48] Dick Frizzell is a famous New Zealand pop artist, known for using older Kiwiana symbols in ways that parody modern culture. For example, Frizzell enjoys imitating the work of foreign artists, giving their works a unique New Zealand view or influence. This is done to show New Zealand's historically subdued impact on the world; naive art is connected to Aotearoan pop art this way.[49] This can be also done in an abrasive and deadpan way, as with Michel Tuffrey's famous work Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000). Of Samoan ancestry, Tuffery constructed the work, which represents a bull, out of processed food cans known as pisupo. It is a unique work of western pop art because Tuffrey includes themes of neocolonialism and racism against non-western cultures (signified by the food cans the work is made of, which represent economic dependence brought on Samoans by the west). The undeniable indigenous viewpoint makes it stand out against more common non-indigenous works of pop art.[50][51] One of New Zealand's earliest and famous pop artists is Billy Apple, one of the few non-British members of the Royal Society of British Artists. Featured among the likes of David Hockney, American R.B. Kitaj and Peter Blake in the January 1961 RBA exhibition Young Contemporaries, Apple quickly became an iconic international artist of the 1960s. This was before he conceived his moniker of 'Billy Apple\", and his work was displayed under his birth name of Barrie Bates. He sought to distinguish himself by appearance as well as name, so bleached his hair and eyebrows with Lady Clairol Instant Creme Whip. Later, Apple was associated with the 1970s Conceptual Art movement. [52] Japan[edit] In Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent avant-garde scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by Harue Koga in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art.[53] The Japanese Gutai movement led to a 1958 Gutai exhibition at Martha Jackson’s New York gallery that preceded by two years her famous New Forms New Media show that put Pop Art on the map.[54] The work of Yayoi Kusama contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol.[55][56] In the mid-1960s, graphic designer Tadanori Yokoo became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from The Beatles, Marilyn Monroe, and Elizabeth Taylor, among others.[57] Another leading pop artist at that time was Keiichi Tanaami. Iconic characters from Japanese manga and anime have also become symbols for pop art, such as Speed Racer and Astro Boy. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as Takashi Murakami and his superflat movement. Italy[edit] In Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the \"Scuola di Piazza del Popolo\" in Rome, with pop artists such as Mario Schifano, Franco Angeli, Giosetta Fioroni, Tano Festa, Claudio Cintoli, and some artworks by Piero Manzoni, Lucio Del Pezzo, Mimmo Rotella and Valerio Adami. Italian pop art originated in 1950s culture – the works of the artists Enrico Baj and Mimmo Rotella to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958–1959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a non-representational genre, despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary kitsch, which turned out to be a \"gold mine\" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists. The novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside \"domestic walls\" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the \"new world\", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including Gianni Ruffi, Roberto Barni, Silvio Pasotti, Umberto Bignardi, and Claudio Cintoli, who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of \"let me have fun\" à la Aldo Palazzeschi.[58] Paul Van Hoeydonck's Fallen Astronaut.\nBelgium[edit] In Belgium, pop art was represented to some extent by Paul Van Hoeydonck, whose sculpture Fallen Astronaut was left on the Moon during one of the Apollo missions, as well as by other notable pop artists. Internationally recognized artists such as Marcel Broodthaers ( 'vous êtes doll? \"), Evelyne Axell and Panamarenko are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was George Segal. Another well-known artist, Roger Raveel, mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of some of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the Vietnam War's increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day. Evelyne Axell from Namur was a prolific pop-artist in the 1964–1972 period. Axell was one of the first female pop artists, had been mentored by Magritte and her best-known painting is Ice Cream.[59] Netherlands[edit] While there was no formal pop art movement in the Netherlands, there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include Daan van Golden, Gustave Asselbergs, Jacques Frenken, Jan Cremer, Wim T. Schippers, and Woody van Amen. They opposed the Dutch petit bourgeois mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include Sex O'Clock, by Woody van Amen, and Crucifix / Target, by Jacques Frenken.[60] Russia[edit] Dmitri Vrubel 's painting My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love (1990).\nRussia was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s, when Russia was a communist country and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was Soviet-themed and was referred to as Sots Art. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power, and with it came a freedom to express. Pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by Dmitri Vrubel with his painting titled My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love in 1990. It might be argued that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.[61] Notable artists[edit] Billy Apple (1935-2021).\nEvelyne Axell (1935–1972).\nSir Peter Blake (born 1932).\nDerek Boshier (born 1937).\nPauline Boty (1938–1966).\nPatrick Caulfield (1936–2005).\nAllan D'Arcangelo (1930–1998).\nJim Dine (born 1935).\nBurhan Dogancay (1929–2013).\nRosalyn Drexler (born 1926).\nRobert Dowd (1936–1996).\nKen Elias (born 1944).\nErró (born 1932).\nMarisol Escobar (1930–2016).\nJames Gill (born 1934).\nDorothy Grebenak (1913-1990).\nRed Grooms (born 1937).\nRichard Hamilton (1922–2011).\nKeith Haring (1958–1990).\nJann Haworth (born 1942).\nDavid Hockney (born 1937).\nDorothy Iannone (born 1933).\nRobert Indiana (1928–2018).\nJasper Johns (born 1930).\nRay Johnson (1927-1995).\nAllen Jones (born 1937).\nAlex Katz (born 1927).\nCorita Kent (1918–1986).\nKonrad Klapheck (born 1935).\nKiki Kogelnik (1935–1997).\nNicholas Krushenick (1929–1999).\nYayoi Kusama (born 1929).\nGerald Laing (1936–2011).\nRoy Lichtenstein (1923–1997).\nRichard Lindner (1901–1978).\nJohn McHale (1922–1978).\nPeter Max (born 1937).\nMarta Minujin (born 1943).\nClaes Oldenburg (born 1929).\nJulian Opie (born 1958).\nEduardo Paolozzi (1924–2005).\nPeter Phillips (born 1939).\nSigmar Polke (1941–2010).\nHariton Pushwagner (1940–2018).\nMel Ramos (1935–2018).\nRobert Rauschenberg (1925–2008).\nLarry Rivers (1923–2002).\nJames Rizzi (1950–2011).\nJames Rosenquist (1933–2017).\nNiki de Saint Phalle (1930–2002).\nPeter Saul (born 1934).\nGeorge Segal (1924–2000).\nColin Self (born 1941).\nMarjorie Strider (1931–2014).\nElaine Sturtevant (1924-2014).\nWayne Thiebaud (born 1920).\nJoe Tilson (born 1928).\nAndy Warhol (1928–1987).\nIdelle Weber (1932–2020).\nJohn Wesley (born 1928).\nTom Wesselmann (1931–2004).\nSee also[edit] Art pop Chicago Imagists Ferus Gallery Sidney Janis Leo Castelli Green Gallery New Painting of Common Objects Figuration Libre (art movement).\nLowbrow (art movement) Nouveau réalisme Neo-pop Op art Plop art Retro art Superflat SoFlo Superflat.\nReferences[edit] ^ Pop Art: A Brief History , MoMA Learning.\n^ a b c d e.\nLivingstone, M., Pop Art: A Continuing History , New York: Harry N.

Or so it might appear. But that is not the real him. Warhol was a seer whose surfaces conceal mysterious waters. “What people think is Andy Warhol isn’t Andy Warhol,” says Tracey Emin. Try an experiment to understand this. Start recording video and sit in front of the camera for three minutes. You are not to speak. You are not to leave your seat. Just look into the camera. “Be yourself.” But who is that? This is what Warhol subjected people to in his Screen Tests, filmed at his New York studio the Factory in the 1960s. His subjects look dazed by an unblinking scrutiny. They can’t win. Whatever they do, the unmoving, unstopping film camera records it as the truth of who they are. Bob Dylan squirms and grimaces, openly contemptuous of the exercise – for which it’s said he grabbed one of Warhol’s Elvis paintings as “payment” – yet that becomes his portrait, and it is painfully callow. A young Lou Reed is soft and vulnerable, but in a later appearance he has learned the game, or thinks he has, and tries to stonewall the camera by keeping his black shades on while drinking a bottle of Coke in a sarcastic dig at Warhol’s pop art. Again, it’s a perfect portrait of who he was at that moment. So if social media were really like Warhol’s Screen Tests, we would be constantly facing our sins in a confessional. We would live in truth. ‘So spiritual about everything’ … Warhol at the Factory in 1968. Photograph: Santi Visalli Inc/Getty Images.\nA more famous Warhol portrait will go on auction at Christie’s in New York in May: his Marilyn, the most iconic face of pop art. Warhol first created it in 1962, the year Monroe took her life, by cropping a publicity still from her early film Niagara to focus solely on her face, then getting a silkscreen mesh made so he could print it on canvas as many times as he liked, adding hand-painted colours. It’s probably his most recognised work, “one of the rarest and most transcendent images in existence”, if you believe the Christie’s blurb, which compares it to the Mona Lisa and Botticelli’s Venus. If Christie’s has got its estimate right, his 1964 painting Shot Sage Blue Marilyn will sell for about $200m (£150m). That will make it the most expensive 20th-century work of art ever auctioned. The current record is held by Picasso. So Andy will be established as bigger than Pablo and therefore the greatest artist of the modern age – at least according to an equation of artistic and monetary value he himself invented. In 1962 Warhol started to literally print dollar bills. He churned out multiple images of the almighty dollar, not as forgeries but works of art. Money is beautiful, these early works of pop art whisper. Later he would get philosophical on the subject. “Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.” But what is it that makes Shot Sage Blue Marilyn so apparently valuable? In 1964 a visitor to Warhol’s studio named Dorothy Podber created her own moment of performance art by pulling a gun and shooting a newly silkscreened Marilyn in the forehead. The shot went through the stack of canvases behind it; the one on sale still bears the poorly concealed scar. That frisson of violence and chaos adds to the sales pitch. But it’s all just the market’s way of catching up with the outrageous and unlikely fact that Andy Warhol is the greatest and most profound artist to have worked anywhere since 1945. Warhol’s portrait of Marilyn seems to sum up so much about him. He made the word “superstar” famous, applying it to anyone who took his eye and could hold their own in the amphetamine-fuelled, sarcastic atmosphere of the Factory. His studio and hangout with silver foil walls came to define 60s Manhattan and regularly gets recreated in films as a plastic fantastic party venue. Warhol mixed adoration of “real” stars such as Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Elvis with a levelling belief that anyone can be a celebrity, at least for a moment. There’s a story that Judy Garland attended a party at the Factory only to be studiously ignored. Warhol made himself a celebrity, too, paving the way for today’s artists with his conscious exploitation of the media in everything from chatshow and soap appearances – albeit monosyllabic ones – to a burger ad that has become a posthumous viral hit. His 70s Polaroid portraits even made the rich and famous pay to become Warhol subjects. He fabricated his own image as an enigmatic svengali figure, portraying himself in half shadow, in shades, in drag. Marilyn Diptych, 1962.

His greatest version of Monroe is not Shot Sage Blue Marilyn. It is Tate Modern’s 1962 Marilyn Diptych, painted just after her death, which repeats her face in bright colours on one canvas while on the other she fades to grey in a haunting film strip of memory failing, fame decaying, time running out. The inner Andy has taken over, and he has more on his mind than fame or money. Emin admits it was only fairly recently that she saw Warhol’s true nature. Like any future artist and David Bowie fan growing up in 70s Margate, she was fascinated by him. “When I was at school I used to imagine that I would go to New York by boat and when I walked down the gangplank Andy Warhol would be there waiting for me.” But later, as a young artist, she would ask herself: “Who would you rather be – Andy Warhol or Joseph Beuys?” In those days Beuys appeared the true visionary to her, the shaman. He was a rear gunner in a Stuka dive bomber in the second world war who got shot down over the Crimea and saved – as he told it – by Tatar shamans who covered his burns with felt and fat. These substances became his ritual materials. Warhol, by contrast, was born in Pittsburgh in 1928, became a successful advertising artist drawing shoes in 50s Manhattan, then turned to fine art at the beginning of the 60s when contemporaries such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Roy Lichtenstein were proving art could be made out of the stuff of everyday life and pop culture. “Warhol always looks external, but he was the real shaman,” Emin thinks now. A shaman can shapeshift and enter other worlds to communicate with spirits and the dead. Take a look at Warhol’s 1963 painting Five Deaths on Orange. In the shocking news image that Warhol has silkscreened in black on an abstract plane of fiery colour, a young man and woman are crawling out of an upside down car. They look back into the twisted metal cage they have escaped, where a woman lies among dead bodies, her eyes blankly staring at yours. Is she dead, near death, dazed? She seems to have seen things the living don’t see. The two survivors look as if they are peering across a mortal threshold, while her eyes meet ours from the far side.

In fact the current record price for one of his works is held by Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), which sold for $105m in 2013. The Warhol we think we know didn’t last long. In 1962, he put on a sensational show of carefully painted Campbell’s soup cans at the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles. The same year he started silkscreening Marilyn’s face. But by 1963 he and his assistant Gerard Malanga were ransacking tabloid news photos, some of which went back to the 1940s, of car crashes and suicides, and silkscreening these as black stains in fields of purple, red, green, silver. That same year John F Kennedy was shot dead and Warhol portrayed Jackie Kennedy at his funeral, her veiled face wounded by the nation’s disaster. In Green Car Crash he repeats over and over, as if he can’t quite believe it, an image in which a man has been thrown out of a car and impaled on a tree. The car burns below his suspended corpse. A witness walks nonchalantly by, apparently unconcerned by this scene of extreme suffering. That indifferent onlooker is exactly what many assume Warhol to have been himself: an unmoved spectator who celebrated not caring, the silver-wigged voyeur numbly pointing a camera. His harshest critic, Robert Hughes, called it “diligent and frigid” in an essay dismissing Warhol as one of the “affectless heroes” of the media age. But in Green Car Crash it is Warhol who portrays, and criticises, such emotionless looking; the man who walks on by is even scarier than the burning car. What the passerby ignores, what we modern secular people are schooled to ignore, is the miracle, the sign, amid the horror. For the man hanging from the tree has been turned into an image of Christ, his body fixed up there for all to see. John Richardson, Picasso’s biographer and a friend of Warhol, revealed in a speech at the artist’s memorial service in 1987 that Warhol attended church regularly all his life and served secretly in soup kitchens. The world has had more than three decades to assimilate this information of Warhol’s religiosity, yet for many it is a bitter wafer. His latest biographer, Blake Gopnik, tries to dismiss the idea of Warhol as a Catholic artist. “Warhol certainly lived a less holy life, made more profane art and committed more mortal sins than should have been on the conscience of any devout Catholic, as defined by his era.” But since when were Catholic artists pure? From Caravaggio, to the novels of Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene, the most powerful religious art is often driven by a sense of damnation. “Warhol was so spiritual about everything,” says Emin. You can go from seeing nothing but materialism in Warhol’s art to seeing the spirit everywhere. Soup cans? The sacrament. Marilyn’s mysterious face? A Byzantine icon; Warhol’s parents were from what is now eastern Slovakia and he was brought up in the Byzantine Catholic faith. And in the Marilyn diptych he explicitly uses the tradition of the medieval Christian altarpiece to depict Monroe as a modern martyr. Green Car Crash (Green Burning Car I), 1963. Photograph: Christie's Images/Bridgeman Images/© 2022 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc/Licensed by DACS, London.\nIf that all seems excessive, Warhol managed to leave a very clear final testament confirming his worldview: an epic series of paintings of The Last Supper, silkscreened from a cheap repro of Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece, in 1986, the year before he died. His life had been shadowed by frailty ever since he was shot, in 1968, by Valerie Solanas. He showed his wounded torso to be photographed by Richard Avedon and painted by Alice Neel, offering the image of himself as tortured saint, flagellated Christ. Emin, who is the same age now that Warhol was when he died, and who recently survived cancer after life-changing surgery, is particularly fascinated by the late Warhol. “I really respect what Andy Warhol did after he was shot. He said all the tax has got to be paid, we’re cleaning up … He just grew up. He got rid of the Factory and got an office and everybody wore suits and ties. He realised all he could really give was to be an artist.” The mirror man Read more.\nIn The Last Supper it is that moment we see. It is his own valedictory feast. For me, the disciples at the table are people from the Factory: Candy Darling, Edie Sedgwick, Billy Name, Ondine. The Factory was not just a party scene. It was Warhol’s most risky venture into the extremes of sin and salvation, a theatre of human possibility and suffering in which the actors didn’t go off stage after two hours but played out their parts to the sometimes awful end. To just see it as the beginning of multimedia art and the death of painting doesn’t quite capture the strange authority of this artist and the milieu he wove around him. When Warhol moved out of fine art it was to let in the life of the streets, where the choices you make are moral, not just aesthetic. “Andy Warhol made the real more real,” says Emin. He could do a very good impression of someone who didn’t give a damn. “Do you think when Edie jumps she’ll let us film it?” he is reputed to have said, apparently hoping Sedgwick would attempt suicide on camera. Yet he too was a character in this morality play, or Catholic novel. Is Warhol the devil leading sinners on an amphetamine-strewn path to hell, the bad Samaritan who does nothing – or rather, the recording angel who sees all? In his Screen Tests the camera is the eye of God. Nothing gets past it. Warhol in 1981. Photograph: Nancy R Schiff/Getty Images.\nIf this all makes Warhol sound a bit romantic, that is exactly what he was. He is one of the few artists in recent times who lived up to the 19th-century cult of the artist as someone other, bohemian, able to see what others don’t. Adopting a distant mysterious persona, surrounding himself with people living on the edge, he took Romanticism into a new realm of modernity. He licensed such inspired chaos it got him shot. So it’s not surprising that this artist so full of mystery and surprise is poised to outsell Picasso and become, by commercial acclaim, the god of modern art. But could we end up killing the thing we love? There’s an edge to Warhol that doesn’t let him slide smoothly into the mainstream. Constant subversion of the pop culture he seems to crave is what makes him so enduring. Christie’s sale of one of his less emotional Marilyns celebrates a middlebrow saint, but he’s not that. “Andy Warhol was not a popular artist,” Emin points out. “He was always alternative: alternative to everything that was going.”.\nTopics Andy Warhol Painting Tracey Emin Art features.\nReuse this content \n", "label": [[40, 51, "ARTIST"], [62, 67, "MONEY"], [73, 79, "ARTIST"], [103, 110, "ARTIST"], [212, 223, "ARTIST"], [328, 350, "WORK_OF_ART"], [352, 356, "DATE"], [372, 382, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [398, 402, "DATE"], [405, 409, "DATE"], [410, 456, "GALLERY"], [479, 485, "GPE"], [487, 509, "WORK_OF_ART"], [511, 515, "DATE"], [531, 541, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [557, 561, "DATE"], [564, 568, "DATE"], [569, 615, "GALLERY"], [638, 644, "GPE"], [661, 676, "DATE"], [704, 719, "DATE"], [731, 742, "ARTIST"], [1022, 1028, "ARTIST"], [1104, 1115, "ARTIST"], [1122, 1133, "ARTIST"], [1141, 1152, "ARTIST"], [1390, 1396, "ARTIST"], [1424, 1436, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1452, 1460, "GPE"], [1487, 1492, "DATE"], [1657, 1666, "ARTIST"], [1765, 1771, "ARTIST"], [2093, 2099, "ARTIST"], [2208, 2214, "ARTIST"], [2217, 2229, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2347, 2353, "ARTIST"], [2372, 2376, "DATE"], [2436, 2442, "ARTIST"], [2474, 2484, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [2488, 2496, "GPE"], [2500, 2503, "DATE"], [2509, 2516, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2551, 2557, "ARTIST"], [2578, 2582, "DATE"], [2665, 2672, "GPE"], [2947, 2957, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [2990, 2999, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3004, 3014, "ARTIST"], [3017, 3022, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3027, 3037, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [3070, 3074, "DATE"], [3084, 3106, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3127, 3132, "MONEY"], [3134, 3139, "MONEY"], [3179, 3191, "DATE"], [3250, 3257, "ARTIST"], [3262, 3266, "ARTIST"], [3302, 3307, "ARTIST"], [3451, 3455, "DATE"], [3456, 3462, "ARTIST"], [3863, 3885, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3913, 3917, "DATE"], [3931, 3937, "ARTIST"], [4349, 4360, "ARTIST"], [4432, 4436, "DATE"], [4438, 4444, "ARTIST"], [4729, 4732, "DATE"], [4733, 4742, "GPE"], [4817, 4823, "ARTIST"], [5075, 5081, "ARTIST"], [5330, 5333, "DATE"], [5397, 5403, "ARTIST"], [5530, 5545, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5547, 5551, "DATE"], [5565, 5579, "ARTIST"], [5588, 5592, "DATE"], [5593, 5639, "GALLERY"], [5663, 5669, "GPE"], [5688, 5694, "ARTIST"], [5771, 5793, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5801, 5812, "MUSEUM"], [5815, 5819, "DATE"], [5820, 5835, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6046, 6050, "ARTIST"], [6115, 6119, "ARTIST"], [6168, 6174, "ARTIST"], [6247, 6250, "DATE"], [6346, 6354, "GPE"], [6400, 6411, "ARTIST"], [6524, 6535, "ARTIST"], [6539, 6551, "ARTIST"], [6568, 6573, "ARTIST"], [6717, 6723, "GPE"], [6856, 6862, "ARTIST"], [6889, 6899, "GPE"], [6903, 6907, "DATE"], [6965, 6968, "DATE"], [6969, 6978, "GPE"], [7028, 7031, "DATE"], [7060, 7072, "ARTIST"], [7074, 7093, "ARTIST"], [7098, 7114, "ARTIST"], [7198, 7204, "ARTIST"], [7257, 7261, "ARTIST"], [7378, 7384, "ARTIST"], [7387, 7391, "DATE"], [7401, 7422, "WORK_OF_ART"], [7456, 7462, "ARTIST"], [7925, 7949, "WORK_OF_ART"], [7953, 7973, "MUSEUM"], [7977, 7992, "GPE"], [8027, 8031, "DATE"], [8032, 8078, "GALLERY"], [8102, 8108, "GPE"], [8137, 8142, "MONEY"], [8149, 8155, "ARTIST"], [8175, 8197, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8293, 8327, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8344, 8349, "MONEY"], [8353, 8357, "DATE"], [8363, 8369, "ARTIST"], [8408, 8412, "DATE"], [8464, 8484, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8488, 8505, "GALLERY"], [8507, 8518, "GPE"], [8559, 8573, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8582, 8586, "DATE"], [8608, 8622, "ARTIST"], [8691, 8696, "DATE"], [8856, 8862, "ARTIST"], [8957, 8972, "WORK_OF_ART"], [9296, 9302, "ARTIST"], [9515, 9521, "ARTIST"], [9581, 9596, "WORK_OF_ART"], [9603, 9609, "ARTIST"], [9984, 9991, "ARTIST"], [10021, 10027, "ARTIST"], [10086, 10090, "DATE"], [10096, 10102, "ARTIST"], [10256, 10262, "ARTIST"], [10379, 10385, "ARTIST"], [10409, 10415, "ARTIST"], [10639, 10649, "ARTIST"], [10774, 10780, "ARTIST"], [10822, 10826, "ARTIST"], [10878, 10884, "ARTIST"], [10995, 11001, "ARTIST"], [11042, 11050, "GPE"], [11113, 11132, "WORK_OF_ART"], [11240, 11277, "WORK_OF_ART"], [11279, 11283, "DATE"], [11297, 11307, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [11334, 11338, "DATE"], [11343, 11385, "GALLERY"], [11409, 11415, "GPE"], [11446, 11452, "ARTIST"], [11556, 11571, "WORK_OF_ART"], [11608, 11626, "ARTIST"], [11644, 11648, "DATE"], [11740, 11744, "DATE"], [11816, 11830, "ARTIST"], [11846, 11856, "ARTIST"], [11927, 11931, "ARTIST"], [11962, 11968, "ARTIST"], [12088, 12094, "ARTIST"], [12119, 12130, "ARTIST"], [12398, 12413, "WORK_OF_ART"], [12634, 12640, "ARTIST"], [13033, 13039, "ARTIST"], [13163, 13174, "ARTIST"], [13206, 13210, "ARTIST"], [13496, 13502, "ARTIST"], [13657, 13669, "WORK_OF_ART"], [13722, 13728, "ARTIST"], [13732, 13736, "DATE"], [13750, 13764, "ARTIST"], [13797, 13803, "ARTIST"], [13920, 13932, "DATE"], [14295, 14302, "ARTIST"], [14427, 14433, "ARTIST"], [14579, 14589, "AUCTION_HOUSE"], [14684, 14695, "ARTIST"], [14723, 14727, "ARTIST"], [14819, 14830, "ARTIST"], [14840, 14851, "ARTIST"]]}

Songs for Drella review – Lou Reed and John Cale’s moving journey into Warhol Read more.\nWhole forests have been flattened trying to unravel the Warhol enigma – Blake Gopnik’s 2020 biography thuds in at 976 pages. Yet in just 55 minutes, Lou Reed and John Cale’s 1990 album and film Songs for Drella get to the heart of a man obscured by his wig, shades and blank expression. Their song cycle starts with Smalltown, a jaunty portrait of Warhol’s childhood in Pittsburgh, “Bad skin, bad eyes, gay and faddy”, through his hyper-productive golden era in the 60s, to his later years battling pain from the wounds sustained when he was shot by Valerie Solanas, author of the Society for Cutting Up Men Manifesto, alienation from collaborators and friends, and a growing dearth of ideas. All the themes biographers have subsequently treated as great revelations – Warhol’s Catholicism, his queerness, his relationship with his mother – are here, explored with taut precision and economy. Andy Warhol (centre) between John Cale and Lou Reed with members of the Velvet Underground and Factory star Paul Morrisey (far right). Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy.\nReed and Cale, of course, had a particular insight into Warhol. They were the creative engine of the Velvet Underground, the rock band the artist managed and produced and whose first album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, ignored on release, became a bible for glam rockers, drag queens, junkies and punks, and is arguably the most influential LP ever made. Given that Reed fired Warhol, then slung Cale out of the band a year later (not face to face, either – he got guitarist Sterling Morrison to do it) relations between the three men were less than cordial. Even the title Songs for Drella is ambivalent: Drella was a nickname used behind Warhol’s back, and which he didn’t like, a conflation of Dracula (the blood-sucking night creature) and Cinderella (the servant who goes to the ball). Yet without any sentimentality, Songs for Drella reveals the warm currents of respect and friendship that lay deep beneath the frosty surface.

Cale and Reed decided to make Songs for Drella after meeting at his memorial service – the first time they’d spoken in years. They finally performed its 14 songs in full at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York, at the end of 1989. Presumably with an eye on the combustible nature of the partnership, as well as on its great cultural significance, someone decided that this performance should be filmed for posterity. Enter the great cinematographer Ed Lachman. Now 76, Lachman photographed Far from Heaven and Carol for Todd Haynes, earning Oscar nominations for both films, and has worked with Sofia Coppola, Wim Wenders and Werner Herzog. It was, however, a music video that got him the Songs for Drella gig. “There was an Aids benefit compilation called Red Hot + Blue,” he remembers, Zooming from a colour correction studio in New York, he is squashed into a corner of the frame so all I can see is one lively eye and his fedora. “I was going to make a video with Derek Jarman and Annie Lennox, but Derek was too sick by then.” Jarman had been diagnosed as HIV positive in 1986, and was to become seriously ill making his 1990 film The Garden. “We met and he gave me home movies of his family when he was growing up, so I had the idea of projecting the images of his childhood over the white pancake face of Annie singing the Cole Porter song Ev’ry Time We Say Goodbye. It was gorgeous and it got a lot of notice, and that’s why Channel 4 came to me and offered me to do this concert.” Yes, the TV station about to be sold off by Nadine Dorries co-produced Songs for Drella, along with Sire Records in the US. ‘I don’t know how I’m going to shoot the concert without any cameras’ … Ed Lachman. Photograph: Marion Curtis/StarPix/AppleTV+/REX/Shutterstock.\nLachman had a meeting with Cale and Reed to discern whether he met with their approval. “Lou was very emphatic and said: ‘I don’t want to see any cameras on the stage and I don’t want cameras to be between me and the audience. Are you all right with that?’ So I said: ‘Well, I don’t know how I’m going to shoot the concert without any cameras.’ “I thought about it, came back the next day and said to them ‘Look, would you let me shoot two of your rehearsals on the stage with no one in the audience and I’ll shoot the performance but the cameras will be off the stage?’ And he agreed.” The result is unlike any other concert film. Lachman’s 16mm camera is so close to the two protagonists that you seem to be reading their thoughts – both about Warhol and about each other. Filmed when both men were 47, Cale looks aristocratic in a black suit and fabulous wedge haircut, while Reed serves disgruntled librarian in a black sweater and octagonal spectacles. Neither of them look like rock stars, and they’re both concentrating hard, facing one another while delivering the vocals (singing isn’t quite the right word in Reed’s case) and hammering on the piano or guitar. Though there are no drums on Songs for Drella, the music is often spiky and percussive – not least on I Believe, in which Reed startlingly declares that Solanas should have received the death penalty for shooting Warhol. In fact she got three years, which tells you something about the low regard in which gay lives were held, even famous ones. As with the Velvet Underground, the abrasive moments are leavened with others of intense sweetness – for instance Style It Takes, in which Warhol coaxes a gorgeous young thing into performing in one of his screen-test films, and which features the self-referential lines: “This is a rock group called the Velvet Underground / I show movies on them, do you like their sound?” At moments like this, the camera lingers on Reed and Cale’s faces. “Sven Vilhem Nykvist, the great cinematographer of Ingmar Bergman, said the face is the landscape for the camera,” Lachman notes. “If there were ever faces that could be landscapes it would be theirs.” The Velvet Underground in Rotterdram in 1993 … John Cale, Maureen Tucker, Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison. Photograph: Rob Verhorst/Redferns.\nTowards the end of Songs for Drella a mood of self-admonishment takes hold, for instance in A Dream, where Cale recites lines taken from Warhol’s diaries such as: “You know I hate Lou, I really do. He won’t even hire us for his videos, and I was so proud of him …” It’s at this point that you look even more closely at Reed and Cale. There’s so much to wonder about as you gaze at their inscrutable expressions. Can we discern regret at their meanness, both to Warhol and to each other, pride in the blazing mutual creativity of their youth, sorrow that it’s too late to do things differently? “It was not only a tribute, an homage, a eulogy, but it was also sort of a confessional,” says Lachman. To that end, Cale and Reed were filmed in near darkness, sometimes with Warhol’s artworks, or the New York Post front page that sneered “Pop goes pop artist” after the shooting, projected above them. “Cameramen like to separate people from the darkness,” Lachmnan adds, “but I wanted them to emerge out of the darkness.” Lachman had first met Reed years before – he had been enlisted to make a video clip for Reed’s baroquely gloomy 1973 album Berlin. “He came up to the camera when I was setting it up, kicked the leg of the tripod and said: ‘Do it like Andy’. I was horrified, I was trying to hold on to the camera that was about to fall on the floor.” By the time of Songs for Drella, Reed had sobered up. “I asked him if he remembered that, and he said ‘I don’t remember much from back then’, smiled and walked back to the microphone.” John Cale and Lou Reed in 1988 at work on what became Songs for Drella. Photograph: New York Times Co./Getty Images.\nSo what was the atmosphere like between Cale and Reed? Did they joke around? “What you see is what you got,” Lachman says. “They showed up and they did the work. I wasn’t hanging out with them after or before, I had my hands full. They didn’t go round the corner for beer.” Indeed, Reed and Cale fell out in the aftermath of Songs for Drella – “Lou always has to be in control,” Lachman notes – before making up and deciding to reform the Velvet Underground. The band toured Europe in 1993 (including, improbably, an appearance at Glastonbury) before Cale and Reed became estranged again. That was it until the band were inducted into the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, which turned out to be their final performance. Reed died in 2013, aged 71; Cale is now 80. He rebuffed approaches to talk about this film. Songs for Drella was broadcast on Channel 4 in 1990, a performance I recorded on VHS, and which seemed to my teenage self to be a transmission from a planet of cryogenic coolness. It’s lived deep within my bones ever since, so it’s a shock to hear that it had actually been “lost” since that first broadcast. In the US, it was released on a laser disc, then disappeared. Lachman tried to find the film while working on Todd Haynes’s documentary about the Velvet Underground, and finally located it during the pandemic, going through boxes of material he’d requested from the Motion Picture Lab in New York. “There, 100ft from my bed, was the actual original negatives, but no sound,” he says.

Early life Andy Warhol was born Andrew Warhola on August 6, 1928, in a two-room apartment at 73 Orr Street in a working-class neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants from an area in the Carpathian Mountains in what is present-day Eastern Slovakia, his parents Andrej and Julia Warhola had three sons, Paul, John, and Andy, the youngest. Unknown, Julia, John, and Andy Warhola, 1932\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n1998.3.5247 In 1934, the family moved to their home at 3252 Dawson Street in Pittsburgh’s South Oakland neighborhood, which was closer to their church St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic. Devout Byzantine Catholics, the family regularly attended mass and observed their Eastern European heritage. Unknown, Andy Warhol's high school graduation photo, 1945\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n1998.3.5219 As a child, Warhol suffered from Sydenham chorea, a neurological disorder commonly known as St. Vitus dance, characterized by involuntary movements. When the disorder occasionally kept him home from school, Warhol would read comics and Hollywood magazines and play with paper cutouts. Growing up in Depression-era Pittsburgh, the family had few luxuries, but Warhol’s parents bought him his first camera when he was eight years old.

Recognizing his son’s talent, Andrej saved money to pay for Warhol’s college education, and he attended Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) from 1945 to 1949. Unknown, Andy Warhol as a young boy, ca. 1936\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n1998.3.5218 Health Throughout his life, Warhol fixated on his physical imperfections. As a child, Sydenham chorea (St. Vitus dance) occasionally kept him bedridden, and he had pigment issues that caused discoloration of his skin, leading to the nicknames “Spot” and “Andy the Red-nosed Warhola.” In response to his perceived physical flaws, Warhol cultivated different looks through his clothing, wigs, cosmetics, and plastic surgery to change the shape of his nose. Later in his life he had premature baldness and massive scars from gunshot wounds suffered in 1968. His lifelong interest in beauty regimes and skin care made its way into his work, with early paintings depicting a nose job, wigs, and pain relief for corns. By the 1980s, Warhol had a near daily exercise regime and took vitamin supplements to improve his hair and skin; he incorporated bodybuilder imagery into his work and exercise equipment populates photographs of his studio.\n 1950s Andy Warhol (right) with classmates Philip Pearlstein and Joan Kramer, visiting Rockefeller Center, ca. 1948\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\nT595 After graduating from art school with a degree in pictorial design, Warhol moved to New York City to pursue a career as a commercial artist, and he dropped the final “a” in Warhola. He moved with fellow classmate Philip Pearlstein and created a circle of close-knit friends including college friend Leila Davies Singeles and dancer Francesca Boas. His work first appeared in a 1949 issue of Glamour magazine, in which he illustrated a story called “What is Success?” An award-winning illustrator throughout the 1950s, some of his clients included Tiffany & Co., I. Miller Shoes, Fleming-Joffe, Bonwit Teller, Columbia Records, and Vogue.

This working method combined drawing with basic printmaking and allowed Warhol to repeat an image and to create multiple illustrations along a similar theme. He could also make color or compositional changes quickly in response to client requests.

Julia was an artist in her own right. Cats and angels were her favorite things to illustrate, and in 1957 Warhol published a book of her drawings, Holy Cats by Andy Warhol’s Mother. Warhol enlisted her to add her feminine and delicate penmanship to hundreds of his drawings, including advertisements, album covers, and book illustrations. Andy Warhol, A coloring book / drawings by Andy Warhol, 1961\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Gift of Mick Byers\n2007.5.1a-b Warhol self-published a large series of artist’s books in the 1950s. He would hold parties at Serendipity 3, a restaurant and ice cream parlor on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where his friends would help him hand color his books. In 1956, he presented a solo exhibition at the Bodley Gallery called Studies for a Boy Book. These sketchbook drawings of portraits of young men and erotic portrayals of male nudes contrasted with the work of other contemporary gay artists, such as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, who considered Warhol “too swish.” Andy Warhol, Seated Male Nude Torso, 1950s\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n© The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n1998.1.1692 Sexuality In the early 1950s, many of Warhol’s friends and fellow artists were accepted to show at the Tanager Gallery in New York City, but the works he submitted were rejected because of their subject matter—two men embracing. Warhol was a gay man, and homosexuality was criminalized in 1950s America. Warhol filled sketchbooks in the 1950s with drawings titled Boy Portraits, which were loving, humorous depictions of the male form and studies of feet, torsos, and genitalia. During his foray into film in the 1960s, Warhol did not shy away from sexuality. His films included scenes of sexual escapades, explicit and not—from turning tricks to sleeping. One of Warhol’s earliest films featured his then-boyfriend, poet John Giorno, sleeping nude in the nearly six-hour-long Sleep (1963). Throughout his career, Warhol blurred the lines between his romantic and professional relationships, mixing business and pleasure. Edward Wallowitch, Ted Carey, John Giorno, Jed Johnson, and Jon Gould were some of Warhol’s business associates with whom he also had intimate relationships. He returned to the male—and female—nude in the 1970s with his Sex Parts and Torso series. In the 1980s, Warhol’s focus on the body in his work and return to hand painting corresponded with the early days of the HIV/AIDS public health crisis, which devastated New York City’s arts scene and gay community.\n Andy Warhol, ca. 1957\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\nT849.2 Entrepreneur As equally as he was an artist, Warhol was an entrepreneur. He kickstarted his career in the 1950s as a commercial illustrator, earning a sizeable revenue to finance his artistic ventures. Warhol grew up during the rise of post-war consumer culture in the U.S. and England and realized the benefit of assembly lines in manufacturing, employing studio assistants and processes to aid his artistic production. Warhol successfully balanced commercial and entrepreneurial endeavors with avant-garde, underground work. He continually pushed himself to experiment in new media—publishing, film, music production, television, fashion, theater—throughout his career and frequently collaborated with artists and brands. Warhol wrote in THEPhilosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again), “Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.”.\n1960s Andy Warhol, Coca-Cola [2], 1961\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution Dia Center for the Arts\n© The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n1997.1.20 In 1960, Warhol turned his attention to the pop art movement, which began in Britain in the mid-1950s. Everyday life inspired pop artists, and their source material became mass-produced products and commercial artifacts of daily life; commercial products entered into the highly valued fine art space. In 1961, Warhol created his first pop paintings, which were based on comics and ads. Warhol’s 1961 Coca-Cola [2] is a pivotal piece in his career, evidence that his transition from hand-painted works to silkscreens did not happen suddenly. The black and gray composition first sketched then hand painted is a blend of both pop and abstraction, which he turned away from at the beginning of his career before experimenting with it again in the 1980s. Andy Warhol, Red Jackie, 1964\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n© The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n1998.1.54 Warhol turned to perhaps his most notable style—photographic silkscreen printing—in 1962. This commercial process allowed him to easily reproduce the images that he appropriated from popular culture. Among Warhol’s first photographic silkscreen works are his paintings of Marilyn Monroe made from a production still from the 1953 film Niagara. In 1962, he began a large series of celebrity portraits, featuring Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Elizabeth Taylor. Warhol made his series of Campbell’s Soup Cans in 1962 and exhibited them the same year in his first solo pop art exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles.

Warhol produced a range of films between 1963 and 1968, beginning with his first feature-length film Sleep (1963), five hours and twenty-one minutes of poet John Giorno asleep. His groundbreaking eight-hour-long silent film Empire (1964) features continuous slow motion footage of the Empire State Building in New York City. In 1966, he made his most commercially successful film, the three-hour-long, double-screen The Chelsea Girls.

Warhol collaborator Billy Name decorated the space with silver paint and aluminum foil, and it became known as the Silver Factory. It was a creative hub for parties and experimentation, from drug use to music and art. Its popularity grew quickly, and it attracted a diverse and inclusive crowd of artists, friends, and celebrities, many of whom posed for short film portraits. With a stationary Bolex camera, from 1964–66 Warhol made almost 500 of these silent four-minute Screen Tests played back in slow motion.

Invoking a factory assembly line and enlisting help from his studio assistants at the Silver Factory, he created hundreds of replicas of large supermarket product boxes—including Brillo Boxes, Heinz Boxes, Del Monte Boxes, and more. The ﬁnished sculptures were nearly indistinguishable from their cardboard supermarket counterparts, single packing cartons. The Brillo Boxes were first exhibited in 1964 at the Stable Gallery in New York where they were tightly packed and piled high, recalling a grocery warehouse.

Created with engineer Billy Klüver, the metallic, floating Silver Clouds sculptures are made of silver plastic film filled with helium and air. Choreographer Merce Cunningham saw the sculptures at the opening and asked Warhol if he could use the floating installation as stage décor for his piece Rainforest (1968).

On June 3, 1968, Valerie Solanas, a writer who had appeared in Warhol’s film I, a Man (1967), came into the studio and shot him. Warhol was physically and emotionally scarred by the nearly fatal shooting. This event significantly altered his working practice from an experimental, collaborative approach to a much more guarded one. The shooting damaged eight organs and left scars across his stomach and torso. The incident and numerous surgeries that followed required that he wear a corset for the rest of his life.

Blotted line allowed him to create a variety of illustrations using the same initial pattern, important to his commercial illustration career when he could bring several ideas to clients. This was the beginning of his lifelong interest to quickly create multiples. Warhol famously quipped, “I want to be a machine,” alluding to his interest in mass production. His most notable style, photographic silkscreen printing, replicated the look of commercial advertising. It gave Warhol a faithful duplication of his source images while allowing him to experiment with various techniques, such as over-printing (printing one color on top of another), registration (aligning colors on a single image), and color combinations. Warhol worked with art assistants and professional printers to produce thousands of silkscreen paintings and print portfolios throughout his lifetime.\n 1970s Warhol became increasingly involved in publishing in the late 1960s, becoming fully immersed in the 1970s. In 1969, he co-founded Interview, a magazine devoted to film, fashion, and popular culture that gave him access to the stars. He published his first mass-produced book, Andy Warhol’s Index (Book), in 1967, and THE Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again) was published in 1975. Published posthumously in 1989, The Andy Warhol Diaries chronicle his daily life from November 24, 1976, through February 17, 1987, five days before he died; his assistant and friend Pat Hackett transcribed their daily phone conversations detailing the previous day’s events.

He had been commissioned previously for album cover designs and painted portraits, but in the 1970s he began to receive hundreds of commissions from socialites, music and film stars, and others. He was a regular at Studio 54, the famous New York disco, along with celebrities such as fashion designer Halston, Liza Minnelli, and Bianca Jagger.

Warhol saw the pervasiveness of Mao’s image in China as akin to Western advertising strategies. By 1974, increasing his painting production, Warhol moved his office to a larger space on the 3rd floor of 860 Broadway on Union Square. The 1970s saw a prolific number of paintings, often including controversial or charged imagery, including Vote McGovern (1972), Ladies and Gentlemen (1975), Skulls (1976), Hammer and Sickle (1976), and Oxidation Paintings (1978), which were created by Warhol friends and studio assistants urinating onto a canvas primed with a metallic paint.

In the 1960s, The Factory became a hangout for artists, musicians, and writers, including Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, Truman Capote, and many more. Warhol’s Superstars, including Edie Sedgwick, Brigid Berlin, Ondine, and Candy Darling, were Factory goers who appeared in his films and became fixtures in his social life. In the 1970s, Warhol was a regular at the New York disco Studio 54, and he received hundreds of portrait commissions from wealthy socialites, musicians, and film stars. He remained in the spotlight in the 1980s with his television work and high-fashion modeling. Warhol achieved stardom, and helped others do the same, realizing his expression, “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.”.\nAndy Warhol, Time Capsule 100, 1973-1974; Bulk: 1974\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\nTC100 Collecting Central to Warhol’s practice were collecting and documenting.

Andy Warhol, Rorschach, 1984\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n© The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n1998.1.296 In 1984, Warhol was commissioned by Alexander Iolas—who also gave Warhol his first solo show in 1952—to create a series of paintings to be installed opposite the convent where Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper is housed. This commission resulted in one of Warhol’s largest bodies of work, comprised of about one hundred works featuring da Vinci’s The Last Supper.

Andy Warhol's grave with Campbell's Soup can,\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh\nR2009.6 On February 22, 1987, Warhol died at New York Hospital in Manhattan due to complications following a surgery to remove his gall bladder.

Andy Warhol, The Last Supper, 1986\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n1998.1.2126 Religion Warhol was born into a devout Byzantine Catholic family that attended mass at Pittsburgh’s St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church. Later in life in New York City, Warhol regularly attended St. Vincent Ferrer to pray and to attend mass. As a child, Warhol would have seen the richly painted iconostasis during mass and learned about this wall of icons and their role in worship in Eastern Catholic churches. Warhol painted religious symbols using imagery such as Raphael’s Madonna, Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, and the cross as source material.\n If you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There’s nothing behind it.\nAndy Warhol, The East Village Other, 1966 Andy Warhol's Grave View a live feed of Warhol’s grave site, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in a project we call Figment.

Wikipedia article References.\nAndy Warhol (/ˈwɔːrhɒl/; born Andrew Warhola; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture, and advertising that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell's Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962), the experimental film Chelsea Girls (1966), and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966–67). Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a commercial illustrator. After exhibiting his work in several galleries in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His New York studio, The Factory, became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons. He promoted a collection of personalities known as Warhol superstars, and is credited with coining the widely used expression \"15 minutes of fame.\" In the late 1960s, he managed and produced the experimental rock band The Velvet Underground and founded Interview magazine. He authored numerous books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism: The Warhol Sixties. He lived openly as a gay man before the gay liberation movement. After gallbladder surgery, Warhol died in February 1987 at the age of 58. Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary films. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105 million for a 1963 canvas titled Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster); his works include some of the most expensive paintings ever sold. A 2009 article in The Economist described Warhol as the \"bellwether of the art market\". Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942) and Julia (née Zavacká, 1892–1972), whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S. His parents were working-class Lemko emigrants from Mikó (now called Miková), located in today's northeastern Slovakia, part of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Warhol's father emigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The family was Ruthenian Catholic and attended St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church. Andy Warhol had two older brothers—Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born before the family emigrated; Ján was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, James Warhola, became a successful children's book illustrator.

Early in his career, he was a successful commercial artist and illustrator, and his work was published in magazines and a variety of print media. In the 1960s, he helped launch the Pop movement with his silkscreened paintings of soup cans, Coca-Cola bottles, celebrities, and comic strips, as well as his prints and sculptures of common objects and household products. His studio, known as the Factory, became a magnet for extreme personalities, and he began shooting films there ca. 1963. In 1965 he announced that he would give up painting for filmmaking, though he continued to produce paintings and prints. His films tested the notion of endurance, 'Sleep' and 'Empire' lasting 5 and 8 hours, respectively. His filmed portraits were often static images of a single subject prolonged over the length of a single reel of film. Warhol embraced media of all kinds, producing experimental books, video works, and multiples. In 1966 and 1967 together with the Velvet Underground he produced the Exploding Plastic Inevitable, a series of multimedia events, as well as an album. He survived an assassination attempt in 1968. During the 1970s he focussed on commissioned portraits, and also founded the magazine 'Interview,' which continues to be published. He is considered by many to be one of the most influential artists of the late 20th century.\n Nationality American.\nGender Male.\nRoles Artist, Cinematographer, Writer, Publisher, Commercial Artist, Collector, Graphic Artist, Illustrator, Installation Artist, Painter, Performance Artist, Photographer, Sculptor.\nNames Andy Warhol, Andrew Warhol, Andrew Warhola, Andrej Varchola, Andrej Warhola.\nUlan 500006031.\nView the full Getty record.\nInformation from Getty’s Union List of Artist Names ® (ULAN), made available under the ODC Attribution License.\nAssociated art terms include Pop art and Silkscreen.\n Works 252 works online Andy Warhol Untitled ([Early Work] Woman) (c. 1946).\nAndy Warhol Untitled ([Early Work] Woman) (c. 1946).\nAndy Warhol Untitled (Roy Rogers) (c. 1948).\nAndy Warhol A Is an Alphabet 1953.\nAndy Warhol, Ralph Thomas Ward (Corkie) Untitled from A is an Alphabet 1953.\nAndy Warhol, Ralph Thomas Ward (Corkie) Untitled from A is an Alphabet 1953.\nAndy Warhol, Ralph Thomas Ward (Corkie) Untitled from A is an Alphabet 1953.\nAndy Warhol, Ralph Thomas Ward (Corkie) Untitled from A is an Alphabet 1953.\nAndy Warhol, Ralph Thomas Ward (Corkie) Untitled from A is an Alphabet 1953.\nAndy Warhol, Ralph Thomas Ward (Corkie) Untitled from A is an Alphabet 1953.\nExhibitions 421: Andy Warhol’s Gold Marilyn Monroe and Francis Bacon’s Study for Three Heads Summer 2021–Fall 2021 Collection gallery MoMA.\nAutomania Jul 4, 2021–Jan 3, 2022 MoMA.\n412: Domestic Disruption Ongoing Collection gallery MoMA.\n411: Andy Warhol’s Empire Fall 2020–Fall 2021 Collection gallery MoMA.\n412: From Soup Cans to Flying Saucers Fall 2019–Fall 2020 Collection gallery MoMA.\n411: Andy Warhol’s Kiss, Blow Job, and Sleep Fall 2019–Fall 2020 Collection gallery MoMA.\nPrivate Lives Public Spaces Oct 21, 2019–May 23, 2021 MoMA.\nJudson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done Sep 16, 2018–Feb 3, 2019 MoMA.\nView all 139 exhibitions.\nAudio Andy Warhol Campbell's Soup Cans 1962.\nAndy Warhol Gold Marilyn Monroe 1962.\nAndy Warhol Kiss, Sleep, Blow Job 1964.\nPublications MoMA Highlights: 375 Works from The Museum of Modern Art Introduction by Glenn D.

Nevertheless, his screenprinted images of Marilyn Monroe, soup cans, and sensational newspaper stories, quickly became synonymous with Pop art. He emerged from the poverty and obscurity of an Eastern European immigrant family in Pittsburgh, to become a charismatic magnet for bohemian New York, and to ultimately find a place in the circles of High Society. For many his ascent echoes one of Pop art's ambitions, to bring popular styles and subjects into the exclusive salons of high art. His crowning achievement was the elevation of his own persona to the level of a popular icon, representing a new kind of fame and celebrity for a fine artist. Warhol's early commercial illustration has recently been acclaimed as the arena in which he first learned to manipulate popular tastes. His drawings were often comic, decorative, and whimsical, and their tone is entirely different from the cold and impersonal mood of his Pop art. Much debate still surrounds the iconic screenprinted images with which Warhol established his reputation as a Pop artist in the early 1960s. Some view his Death and Disaster series, and his Marilyn pictures, as frank expressions of his sorrow at public events. Others view them as some of the first expressions of 'compassion fatigue' - the way the public loses the ability to sympathize with events from which they feel removed. Still others think of his pictures as screens - placed between us and horrifying events - which attempt to register and process shock.\n Although artists had drawn on popular culture throughout the 20 th century, Pop art marked an important new stage in the breakdown between high and low art forms. Warhol's paintings from the early 1960s were important in pioneering these developments, but it is arguable that the diverse activities of his later years were just as influential in expanding the implications of Pop art into other spheres, and further eroding the borders between the worlds of high art and popular culture.\n Although Warhol would continue to create paintings intermittently throughout his career, in 1965 he \"retired\" from the medium to concentrate on making experimental films. Despite years of neglect, these films have recently attracted widespread interest, and Warhol is now seen as one of the most important filmmakers of the period, a forefather of independent film. Critics have traditionally seen Warhol's career as going into decline in 1968, after he was shot by Valerie Solanas. Valuing his early paintings above all, they have ignored the activities that absorbed his attention in later years - parties, collecting, publishing, and painting commissioned portraits. Yet some have begun to think that all these ventures make up Warhol's most important legacy because they prefigure the diverse interests, activities, and interventions that occupy artists today.\n Warhol famously said that \"business art is the step that comes after Art. I started as a commercial artist, and I want to finish as a business artist.\" He became one of the world most successful artists, and made screen prints, sculptures, films, managed a band, and even designed wallpaper - projects that were often highly lucrative (and always built his brand).

Warhol was one of the artists that felt the need to bring back imagery into his work. The gallery owner and interior designer Muriel Latow gave Warhol the idea of painting soup cans, when she suggested to him that he should paint objects that people use every day (it is rumored that Warhol ate the soup for lunch every single day). He painted Campbell's soup cans, Brillo boxes, and Coca-Cola bottles from 1962 onward.\n Warhol started his career and became an extremely successful consumer ad designer. Here, he used the techniques of his trade to create an image that is both easily recognizable, but also visually stimulating. Consumer goods and ad imagery were flooding the lives of Americans with the prosperity of that age and Warhol set out to subtly recreate that abundance, via images found in advertising. He recreated on canvas the experience of being in a supermarket. So, Warhol is credited with envisioning a new type of art that glorified (and also criticized) the consumption habits of his contemporaries and consumers today. Screenprint - Multiple museums, galleries, and collections.\nArtwork Images 1962 Coca-Cola (3) \"I just paint things I always thought were beautiful, things you use every day and never think about.\" Warhol's statement epitomizes his ethos; his works put ordinary items front and center. This idea applies to the hand-painted portrait of a Coca-Cola bottle. Another challenge to the domination of Abstract Expressionism, Warhol's Coca-Cola is equal in size to many of the popular canvases of the time (6ft x 5ft) but is devoid of their abstractions. However, there are some other similarities here. As in Barnett Newman's popular Stations of the Cross series of works, Coca-Cola is comprised of a large, black mass on a white background. The bottle jumps out at the viewer; demanding the kind of attention Motherwell's profound canvases received - yet now the sense of irony reigns. Casein on cotton - Private Collection.\n1962 Gold Marilyn Monroe After her sudden death from an overdose of sleeping pills in August 1962, superstar Marilyn Monroe's life, career, and tragedy became a worldwide obsession. Warhol, being infatuated with fame and pop culture, obtained a black-and-white publicity photo of her (from her 1953 film Niagara) and used the photo to create several series of images. A common idea to all the Marilyn works was that her image was reproduced over and over again as one would find it reprinted in newspapers and magazines at the time. After viewing dozens, or hundreds of such images, a viewer stops seeing a person depicted, but is left with an icon of popular, consumer culture. The image (and the person) become another cereal box on the supermarket shelf, one of hundreds of boxes - which are all exactly the same.\n In Gold Marilyn Monroe, Warhol further plays on the idea iconography, placing Marilyn's face on a very large golden-colored background. The background is reminiscent of Byzantine religious icons that are the central focus in Orthodox faiths to this day. Only instead of a god, we are looking at an image (that becomes a bit garish upon closer inspection) of a woman that rose to fame and died in horrible tragedy. Warhol subtly comments on our society, and its glorification of celebrities to the level of the divine. Here again the Pop artist uses common objects and images to make very pointed insights into the values and surroundings of his contemporaries. Silkscreen - The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\nArtwork Images 1963 Sleep In the early 1960s, during a period of immense creativity, Warhol continued to challenge the status quo through a different medium, film. Over his career Warhol made over 650 films spanning a wide range of subjects. His films were lauded by the art world, and their influence is seen in performance art and expiremental filmmaking to this day. In 2013 the actress Tilda Swinton participated in an installation where she slept in a glass box at MoMA and the writer, actress, and director Lena Dunham recently expressed her desire to remake Warhol's Sleep shot for shot, but with herself as the subject.\n Sleep is one of the artist's earliest films and his first foray into durational film, a style that became one of his signatures. This six-hour movie is a detailed exploration of John Giorno sleeping. Warhol's lover at the time, the viewer sees Giorno through Warhol's eyes, a strip of Giorno's naked body is in every scene. Although this seems to be a series of continuous images, it is actually six one hundred foot rolls of film layered and spliced together, played on repeat. Repetition was at the heart of Warhol's oeuvre, as well as his fascination with the mundane. All people need to sleep; Warhol once again transformed banality into artistic expression.\n Empire and Eat succeeded Sleep in the canon of Warhol's duration films. Empire chronicles eight hours of the Empire State Building at dusk and Eat is a 45 minute film about a man eating a mushroom. Warhol's themes were as expansive as his filmography, delving into more explicit areas such as homosexuality and gay culture, such as Blowjob, a continuous shot of DeVeren Bookwalter's face while he receives oral sex from filmmaker Willard Maas, and Lonesome Cowboys, a raunchy western. His films are widely recognized as Pop masterpieces, enshrined in film institutes and modern art archives across the world. Black and White 16mm film - The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\nArtwork Images 1963 Orange Car Crash Fourteen Times Orange Car Crash is from the Death and Disaster series that consumed much of Warhol's attention in this period. Often using gruesome and graphic images taken from daily newspapers, he would use the photo-silkscreening method to repeat them across the canvas. The repetition of the image, and its fragmentation and degradation, are important in creating the impact of the pictures, but also in sterilizing the image. To see the graphic photo once leaves the viewer distraught and shaken - but to see that photo reproduced over and over again (as seen every day in the press) undermines the image's power as the scene of horror becomes another mass-market image.\n There is an alternative way to view this and other works from Warhol's Death and Disaster series proposed by the Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight. The car crash shown is very similar to the photo of the Long Island car crash in which Jackson Pollock died in 1956. Warhol is reminding the viewers that Abstract Expressionism (championed by Pollock) is now dead. So maybe Warhol is not so much involved in popular art, but rather providing very specific and elite art world commentary. Similarly, Warhol's Electric Chair series has a \"Silence\" sign at the back of the depicted electrocution room, which Warhol connects to John Cage's modernist work with sound (and Cage's 1961 book of essays). And even further, Warhol's Race Riot series is a response to the many popular abstract works that are each labeled Black Series from modern artists such as Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Ad Reinhardt, and Frank Stella. Silkscreen print on canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\nArtwork Images 1964 Brillo Boxes Still using the silkscreen technique, this time on plywood, Warhol presented the viewer with exact replicas of commonly used products found in homes and supermarkets. This time, his art pieces are stackable, they are sculptures that can be arranged in various ways in the gallery - yet each box is exactly the same, one is no better than another. Rather than the series of slightly different paintings that have been made by many famous artists (think Monet's haystacks or cathedrals) Warhol makes the point that these products are all the same and (in his opinion) they are beautiful! Making these items in his \"factory\" Warhol again makes fun of (or brilliantly provokes) the art world and the artist-creator.\n With Brillo Boxes, Warhol also has a personal connection. Warhol was originally from Pittsburg - steel city, the commodity that made the city prosperous and later quite depressed. Brillo is steel wool, a product stereotypically used by housewives to keep cookware shining in their lovely American homes. Did Warhol like the product itself, think the store displays for the product ridiculous, or as a gay man, did he enjoy the contrast of steel and wool, in one friendly package? Acrylic silkscreen on wood - Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena, California.\nArtwork Images 1973 Mao Warhol combines paint and silkscreen in this image of Mao Zedong, a series that he created in direct reaction to President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. Warhol took the black and white image of Mao from his Little Red Book (Mao's famous communist publication), and created hundreds of different sized canvases of the totalitarian ruler. Some of these paintings are as large as 15 feet x 10 feet, a scale evoking the dominating nature of Mao's rule over China and the awesome cult of personality Mao wielded. This monumental size also echoes the towering propagandistic representations that were being displayed throughout China during the Cultural Revolution. But by creating hundreds of such images, and lining them up on the wall, Warhol made the image of Mao into a supermarket product - like Coca-Cola bottles - lined up on the shelves (and available in small, medium, and large). Warhol's Mao is now a consumer product, a basic building block of capitalism - or the very idea that communism is against.\n Warhol goes even further. The graffiti-like splashes of color, the red rouge and blue eye shadow, literally 'de-faces' Mao's image - an act of rebellion against the Communist propaganda machine by using its own heralded image against itself. Warhol uses modernist art devices such as expressionistic brushstrokes around Mao's face as a further pun: the brushstrokes are a sign of personal expression and artistic freedom - the very ideas that Mao's Cultural Revolution was against. Synthetic polymer paint and silkscreen ink on canvas - The Art Institute of Chicago.\nArtwork Images 1978 Oxidation Painting Created late in Warhol's career, Oxidation Painting is part of a series of works that was produced by the artist alone, or with a group of his friends, and made by urinating on a canvas of copper paint that was placed horizontally on the floor and then allowing the result to oxidize. The result was a metallic sheen with a surprising depth of color and texture; a surface reminiscent of works by Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock. Warhol put much thought and design into these works, and is quoted as saying, \"[these paintings] had technique, too. If I asked someone to do an Oxidation painting, and they just wouldn't think about it, it would just be a mess. Then I did it myself -- and it's just too much work -- and you try to figure out a good design.\" Urine on metallic pigment in acrylic pigment on canvas - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\nArtwork Images 1984 Rorschach Although Warhol's earliest work declared a dramatic break with Abstract Expressionism, he remained interested in abstraction throughout his career, and, in 1984, focused his ideas into his large series of Rorschach paintings. They were inspired by the so-called Rorschach test, devised by the Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach. The test requires patients to say what they see in a set of ten standardized ink blots; in this way Rorschach believed we might gain access to unconscious thoughts. Warhol believed that much abstract painting functioned in a similar way: instead of artists being able to communicate thoughts through abstract form, as many believed, he thought that viewers simply projected their own ideas on to the pictures. His Rorschach pictures were therefore a kind of parody of abstract painting: they were mirrors which reflected the viewer's own thoughts, and at times they seemed to resemble genitalia or wallpaper designs. Synthetic polymer paint on canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\nArtwork Images 1984 General Electric with Waiter It was at the suggestion of art dealer Bruno Bischofsberger that Warhol began collaborating on paintings. He worked first with the Italian Francesco Clemente, and with the much younger, Haitian-American painter Jean-Michel Basquiat; later he produced work with Keith Haring. Warhol's reputation was flagging in the early 1980s, and he had painted little since the 1960s, but his collaboration with Basquiat, which spanned two years between 1984-5, energized him and placed him amidst a young and more fashionable generation. General Electric with Waiter is typical of the pictures the pair produced together: Warhol contributed enlarged headlines, brand names and fragments of advertisements; Basquiat added his expressive graffiti. The success of the series rested on the cartoon qualities inherent in both Pop art and graffiti. Acrylic and oil on canvas - Collection unknown.\nArtwork Images 1986 Self-Portrait Warhol's self portraits that he created throughout his career reveal an underlying theme. It can be argued that Warhol's most successful artwork was the image of himself, invented and reinvented over his body of work. Simply consider the fact that Warhol started his art career as a nerdy, shy, balding designer and ended it as a star whose popularity could match his greatest depictions (Monroe, Elvis, Mao).\n In this particular work, the focus is on Warhol's head and wig (one of dozens he wore over the years). By using repetitive images, each slightly different to the next, and then overlapping the images, Warhol produces the illusion of movement. Created towards the end of his life, Self-Portrait displays the artist in his signature wig, and also makes dramatic use of shadow and light. Synthetic polymer paint and silkscreen ink on canvas - The National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.\nArtwork Images 1986 The Last Supper Behind Warhol's silver wig and black glasses (of Campbells Soup, Marylin, and drug/sex film fame) was a devout Catholic who went to mass and volunteered at homeless shelters regularly. Warhol's mother was a very religious woman who instilled in him a connection to the church.\n Warhol's religiosity is most exemplified by the late works that he created based on Leonardo Da Vinci's The Last Supper (1495–1498). Warhol based his works on a black and white photograph of a popular 19th century engraving and ended up producing over a hundred drawings, paintings, and silkscreens of the Renaissance masterpiece. From superimposing brand names over the faces of the apostles, to cutting up the unity of the scene, Warhol honored the original painting while adding it into his business enterprise.

Drawing on his background as a commercial illustrator, he depicted best-selling products such as Campbell’s Soup cans, Coca Cola bottles and Brillo boxes, as well as instantly recognisable figures including Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Kennedy and Elvis Presley. Reflecting the shift towards mass consumption and prolific reproduction, he often used serial repetition and mechanical processes such as silkscreen printing. At the time a primarily commercial technique, silkscreen printing allowed an unlimited number of repetitions and variations on a chosen subject. As Warhol described, 'you pick a photograph, blow it up, transfer it in glue onto silk, and then roll ink across it so the ink goes through the silk but not through the glue. That way you get the same image, slightly different each time. It was all so simple – quick and chancy.' Strategies borrowed from printmaking, including multiplicity, mirroring and replication, would become central to his practice. He distanced the artist's hand from the work itself, continuing the trajectory of Marcel Duchamp's readymades, and reimagined what art could be in an age of immense social, political and technological change.\n Read more Download CV.\nA pioneer and central figure of Pop art, Andy Warhol used everyday commodities and celebrity portraits from mass media as his subject matter, creating enduring images that have come to define his era.

He distanced the artist's hand from the work itself, continuing the trajectory of Marcel Duchamp's readymades, and reimagined what art could be in an age of immense social, political and technological change. Warhol's legendary silver-painted and foil-draped studio, nicknamed The Factory, became a social and creative hub where many younger artists' careers were launched, including Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat and rock band The Velvet Underground. A pioneering and prolific film-maker, he documented visitors to the studio in Polaroids and the 472 individual filmed portraits that make up his Screen Tests (1964–66). Many of his films are now considered avant-garde cinema classics, such as Empire (1964), an eight-hour stationary shot of the Empire State Building that tested the limits of an audience's attention-span. Born in Pittsburgh in 1928, Warhol studied at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in his hometown before moving to New York. He began his career in the 1950s as an illustrator at an advertising agency and this background in fashion and design had a tremendous influence on his artistic output. In 1962, his work was included in the first important survey of Pop art, The New Realists exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery, as well as solo exhibitions at Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles and Stable Gallery, New York. By 1964 he had established The Factory in a Manhattan loft where he organised parties and artistic events, and he launched Interview magazine in 1969. Two years after his death in 1987, Warhol was the subject of a retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. His work has been widely exhibited at international institutions, including recent retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2018); Tate Modern, London (2020); and Museum Ludwig, Cologne (2020–21) .

By imitating the familiar aesthetics of mass media, advertising, and celebrity culture, Warhol blurred the boundaries between his work and the world that inspired it, producing images that have become as pervasive as their sources. Warhol grew up in a working-class suburb of Pittsburgh. His parents were Slovak immigrants, and he was the only member of his family to attend college. He entered the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1945, where he majored in pictorial design. After graduation, he moved to New York with fellow student Philip Pearlstein and found steady work as a commercial illustrator at several magazines, including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, and the New Yorker. Throughout the 1950s Warhol enjoyed a successful career as a commercial artist, winning several commendations from the Art Directors Club and the American Institute of Graphic Arts. He had his first solo exhibition at the Hugo Gallery in 1952, showing drawings based on the writings of Truman Capote; three years later his work was included in a group show at the Museum of Modern Art for the first time. The year 1960 marked a turning point in Warhol’s prolific career. He painted his first works based on comics and advertisements, enlarging and transferring the source images onto canvas using a projector. In 1961 Warhol showed these hand-painted works, including Little King (1961) and Saturday’s Popeye (1961), in a window display at the department store Bonwit Teller; in 1962 he painted his famous Campbell’s Soup Cans, thirty-two separate canvases, each depicting a canned soup of a different flavor. Soon after, Warhol began to borrow not only the subject matter of printed media, but the technology as well. Incorporating the silkscreen technique, he created grids of stamps, Coca-Cola bottles, shipping and handling labels, dollar bills, coffee labels, and more, breaking down the images to their basic graphic components. In 1963 Warhol established a studio on East 47th Street, which became known as the Factory and served as a cultural hub for artists, models, performers, and socialites. His inner circle comprised his Superstars, who played a major role in both his work and his social life. Interested in the production of fame, Warhol began to screen-print images of celebrities and public figures, from Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley to Jackie Kennedy and Mao Zedong. Expanding his practice, as well as his cultural influence, he produced records (The Velvet Underground & Nico), started a magazine (Interview), and made avant-garde films, such as Chelsea Girls (1966), Blow Job (1964), and Empire (1964), which have become classics of the underground genre. Following a close run-in with death when Valerie Solanas shot him in 1968, Warhol entered a more subdued, isolated period, working primarily on a commissioned basis and painting portraits for various patrons, while also revisiting themes from his earlier work. He then began to pursue a new interest in abstraction, first with his Oxidations (1977–78), made by allowing friends and acquaintances to urinate on canvases painted with metallic pigments, and later with his Rorschach (1984) and Camouflage (1986) paintings. By the early 1980s Warhol was producing work across media with a renewed vigor, hosting half-hour programs on MTV, publishing books, and collaborating with younger artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Francesco Clemente, and Keith Haring. His abstract series coincided with large-scale works that looked back at masterpieces by Leonardo da Vinci: he screen-printed images of the Mona Lisa (1503) and created several monumental canvases of The Last Supper (1495–98). Warhol’s ability to seamlessly combine art historical reference, abstract patterns, and mass media set new standards for the role of the artist, permanently blurring the lines between commercial and fine art.\n #AndyWarhol Facebook Twitter E-mail.\nDownload Listed Exhibitions (Selected) (PDF).\nExhibitions Warhol\n            \nBardot October 10–November 12, 2011 Davies Street, London.\nAndy Warhol\n            \nLiz September 16–October 22, 2011 West 21st Street, New York.\nWarhol from the Sonnabend Collection January 20–February 28, 2009 980 Madison Avenue, New York.\nAndy Warhol\n            \nCast a Cold Eye: The Late Works of Andy Warhol October 25–December 22, 2006 West 21st Street, New York.\nAndy Warhol\n            \nCast a Cold Eye: The Late Works of Andy Warhol October 25–December 22, 2006 555 West 24th Street, New York.\nAndy Warhol\n            \nEarly Hand-Painted Works September 22–October 22, 2005 980 Madison Avenue, New York.\nAndy Warhol\n            \nLate Paintings February 26–April 17, 2004 Beverly Hills.\nAndy Warhol\n            \nDrawings & Related Works 1951–1986 February 13–March 22, 2003 980 Madison Avenue, New York.\nSee all Exhibitions for Andy Warhol.\nFrom the Quarterly The Art History of Presidential Campaign Posters Against the backdrop of the 2020 US presidential election, historian Hal Wert takes us through the artistic and political evolution of American campaign posters, from their origin in 1844 to the present.

The Whitney was established in 1930 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney to champion the work of living American artists. A sculptor and a patron, Whitney recognized both the importance of contemporary American art and the need to support the artists who made it. The collection she assembled foregrounds how artists uniquely reveal the complexity and beauty of American life. Work by Jay DeFeo, Willem de Kooning, Roy Lichtenstein, Man Ray, Ed Ruscha, Andy Warhol, and Tom Wesselmann is included.

The exhibition examines themes such as life and death, power and desire, the role and representation of women, Renaissance imagery, family and immigrant traditions and rituals, depictions and duplications of Christ, and the Catholic body and queer desire. Among the more than one hundred objects on view are rare source materials and newly discovered items that provide a fresh and intimate look at Warhol’s creative process, as well as major paintings and films.

A single painting in multiple parts, Shadows is one of Warhol’s most abstract works, yet one that cohesively synthesizes key elements of his practice, including film, painting, photography, and screen printing. The installation surrounds the viewer with a series of canvases, presented edge-to-edge around the perimeter of the room, in conformity with Warhol’s original vision. Most recently the work was installed by Dia at the Calvin Klein Headquarters in New York. Installation view, Andy Warhol: Shadows, Dia:Beacon, New York, 2003–11.

A single painting in multiple parts, Shadows is one of Warhol’s most abstract works, yet one that cohesively synthesizes key elements of his practice, including film, painting, photography, and screenprinting. Originally commissioned by Dia and acquired in 1979 for a solo exhibition at 393 West Broadway in New York City, Shadows includes a total of 102 canvases; the final number of canvases on view in each installation is determined by the dimensions of an existing exhibition space. For the installation at Dia Beacon, 72 canvases will be installed edge to edge, a foot above the floor. The conservation of this work was made possible by CALVIN KLEIN. Dia Beacon Interactive Floor Plan.\nExhibition Information In 1979 Andy Warhol presented Shadows at the New York City gallery of Dia Art Foundation cofounder Heiner Friedrich. The installation featured the environmentally scaled painting in multiple parts, which the artist created between 1978 and 1979. As “one painting,” Shadows consists of 102 equally sized canvases hung edge to edge and low to the ground (but not too low to be kicked, as Warhol noted in his review of his 1979 show for New York magazine). While fixed by these physical terms, Shadows is nonetheless contingent in its presentation. Since the number of panels shown and the order of their arrangement varies according to the size of the exhibition space, the work in total contracts, expands, and recalibrates each time that it is installed. The all-encompassing (if modular) scale of Shadows simultaneously recalls Warhol’s use of wallpaper to enhance the sensorial enclosure of an installation and his interest in the techniques of photography and serigraphy, which have the potential for serial repetition. In Shadows the rote silkscreens are offset and inflected by the loose, gestural mopping of paint in a range of colors onto each canvas. In the late 1970s he increasingly explored the notion of abstraction. Shifting his focus away from recognizable imagery and traditional painterly materials, Warhol began to work with found subjects of abstraction, as evident in his series of Oxidation paintings (produced by the interaction of urine and metallic pigment) and, later, his Camouflage paintings. As his interest in abstraction grew, Warhol began to explore the concept of a shadow and its tonal variations in a set of studio photographs. These images would serve as the basis for Shadows, a group of monochromatic canvases, each displaying an abstract image that references a picture of a shadow in Warhol’s office. The silhouette was transferred to silkscreens and applied as either a positive or negative value onto the right side of each canvas. Shadows features a wide variety of colors and hues, such as acra violet, cadmium yellow, cobalt blue, phthalo green, and the artist’s signature silver. The colors were applied to each canvas using a sponge mop or brush. Warhol is known for his luminous palettes, as evident in the psychedelic sequencing of acid greens and fluorescent pinks applied to self-portraits and images of Mao Zedong, Marilyn Monroe, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and other international notables. In these works, found photographs culled from popular sources are isolated and altered through the abstraction of the silkscreen stencil and the application of color to reconfigure context and meaning. The replication of a seemingly abstract gesture (a jagged peak and horizontal extension) across the panels of Shadows further minimizes the potential to ascribe any narrative logic to Warhol’s work.Rather, as he dryly explained, the paintings are mostly the same except for their colors: that is, in Shadows color assumes the position of the work’s subject. Despite Warhol’s self-effacing dismissal of the works as “disco décor” (the opening party, he wrote, “had disco”), these paintings substantiate a genuine interest in composition, method, and style, indeed the practice of painting itself. Commissioned by Dia Art Foundation, Shadows is exemplary of the relationships that the burgeoning foundation (founded by Friedrich, Philippa de Menil, and Helen Winkler in 1974) fostered with artists. In addition to commissioning these canvases, Dia worked with Warhol to amass an unrivaled collection of his paintings and works on paper. Dia’s mission has always been to support artists through both the commission and long-term presentation of works of art. In fulfillment of this goal, Dia donated the vast majority of its Warhol holdings to the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, where they became part of the museum’s founding collection and permanent display when it opened to the public in 1994.\n Checklist  Shadows, 1978–79\nAcrylic and oil-modified alkyd on canvas\nDia Art Foundation.\nAbout the Artist Andy Warhol was born in Pittsburgh in 1928. He studied pictorial design at the city’s Carnegie Institute of Technology, then moved to New York City upongraduation. Relinquishing a successful and acclaimed career as a commercial illustrator in New York in the 1950s, he began exhibiting paintings with silkscreened Pop imagery in 1962. In 1963 he started producing films and other projects, including Interview magazine, which was first published in 1969. Retrospectives of his work have been organized by the Pasadena Art Museum (1970), California; Museum of Modern Art (1989), New York; Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin (2002); and Whitney Museum of American Art (2018), New York. Dia exhibited the artist’s work in New York from the late 1970s through the 1990s and donated its entire collection of his works, except for Shadows, to the newly opened Andy Warhol Museum in 1994. In 2005–06 Shadows formed the centerpiece of the exhibition Dia’s Andy: Through the Lens of Patronage at Dia Beacon, a celebration of the institution’s history with the artist. After its long-term display at Dia Beacon, the work traveled to institutions across the United States and venues in Bilbao, Paris, and Shanghai.\n Andy Warhol  Andy Warhol was born in Pittsburgh in 1928. He died in New York City in 1987.

His maternal grandfather served as cantor of the synagogue in Pune. At the time, Baghdadi Jews constituted the majority of the Jewish community in Mumbai.[20] His father was a hydrographer and applied physicist who served in the Indian Navy.[21] Kapoor is the brother of Ilan Kapoor, a professor at York University, Toronto, Canada.[22] Kapoor attended The Doon School, an all-boys boarding school in Dehradun, India.[23] In 1971 he moved to Israel with one of his two brothers, initially living on a kibbutz.[24] He began to study electrical engineering,[20][25] but had trouble with mathematics and quit after six months.[26] In Israel, he decided to become an artist.[20] In 1973, he left for Britain to attend Hornsey College of Art and Chelsea School of Art and Design.[21] There he found a role model in Paul Neagu, an artist who provided a meaning to what he was doing.[27] Kapoor went on to teach at Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1979 and in 1982 was Artist in Residence at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. He has lived and worked in London since the early 1970s.[28] Career[edit] Kapoor became known in the 1980s for his geometric or biomorphic sculptures using simple materials such as granite, limestone, marble, pigment and plaster.[29] These early sculptures are frequently simple, curved forms, usually monochromatic and brightly coloured, using powder pigment to define and permeate the form. He has said of the sculptures \"While making the pigment pieces, it occurred to me that they all form themselves out of each other. So I decided to give them a generic title, A Thousand Names, implying infinity, a thousand being a symbolic number. The powder works sat on the floor or projected from the wall. The powder on the floor defines the surface of the floor and the objects appear to be partially submerged, like icebergs. That seems to fit inside the idea of something being partially there...\"[30] Such use of pigment characterised his first high-profile exhibit as part of the New Sculpture exhibition at the Hayward Gallery London in 1978.[31] Holocaust Memorial, Liberal Jewish Synagogue London, 1996.\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, Kapoor was acclaimed for his explorations of matter and non-matter, specifically evoking the void in both free-standing sculptural works and ambitious installations. Many of his sculptures seem to recede into the distance, disappear into the ground or distort the space around them. In 1987, he began working in stone.[32] His later stone works are made of solid, quarried stone, many of which have carved apertures and cavities, often alluding to, and playing with dualities (earth-sky, matter-spirit, lightness-darkness, visible-invisible, conscious-unconscious, male-female, and body-mind). \"In the end, I’m talking about myself. And thinking about making nothing, which I see as a void. But then that’s something, even though it really is nothing.\"[30] Since 1995, he has worked with the highly reflective surface of polished stainless steel. These works are mirror-like, reflecting or distorting the viewer and surroundings. Over the course of the following decade Kapoor's sculptures ventured into more ambitious manipulations of form and space. He produced a number of large works, including Taratantara (1999),[33] a 35-metre-high piece which was installed in the Baltic Flour Mills in Gateshead, England, prior to the renovation beginning there which turned the structure into the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art; and Marsyas (2002), a large work consisting of three steel rings joined by a single span of PVC membrane that reached end to end of the 3,400-square-foot (320 m2) Turbine Hall of Tate Modern. Kapoor's Eye in Stone (Norwegian: Øye i stein) is permanently placed at the shore of the fjord in Lødingen in northern Norway as part of Artscape Nordland. In 2000, one of Kapoor's works, Parabolic Waters, consisting of rapidly rotating coloured water, was shown outside the Millennium Dome in London. The use of red wax is also part of his repertoire, evocative of flesh, blood, and transfiguration.[34] In 2007, he showed Svayambh (which translated from Sanskrit means \"self-generated\"), a 1.5-metre block of red wax that moved on rails through the Nantes Musée des Beaux-Arts as part of the Biennale estuaire; this piece was shown again in a major show at the Haus der Kunst in Munich and in 2009 at the Royal Academy in London.[35] Some of Kapoor's work blurs the boundaries between architecture and art. In 2008, Kapoor created Memory in Berlin and New York for the Guggenheim Foundation, his first piece in Cor-Ten, which is formulated to produce a protective coating of rust.[36] Weighing 24 tons and made up of 156 parts, it calls to mind Richard Serra's huge, rusty steel works, which also invite viewers into perceptually confounding interiors.[37] In 2009, Kapoor became the first Guest Artistic Director of Brighton Festival. Kapoor installed four sculptures during the festival: Sky Mirror at Brighton Pavilion gardens; C-Curve[38] at The Chattri, Blood Relations (a collaboration with author Salman Rushdie); and 1000 Names, both at the Fabrica Gallery. He also created a large site-specific work titled The Dismemberment of Jeanne d’Arc and a performance-based installation: Imagined Monochrome.[39] The public response was so overwhelming that police had to re-divert traffic around C Curve at the Chattri and exercise crowd control. In September 2009, Kapoor was the first living artist to have a solo exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts. As well as surveying his career to date, the show also included new works. On display were Non-Object mirror works, cement sculptures previously unseen, and Shooting into the Corner,[40] a cannon that fires pellets of wax into the corner of the gallery. Previously shown at MAK, Vienna, in January 2009, it is a work with dramatic presence and associations and also continues Kapoor's interest in the self-made object, as the wax builds up on the walls and floor of the gallery the work slowly oozes out its form. In early 2011, Kapoor's work, Leviathan,[7] was the annual Monumenta installation for the Grand Palais in Paris.[41][42] Kapoor described the work as: \"A single object, a single form, a single colour...My ambition is to create a space with in a space that responds to the height and luminosity of the Nave at the Grand Palais. Visitors will be invited to walk inside the work, to immerse themselves in colour, and it will, I hope, be a contemplative and poetic experience.\" In 2011, Kapoor exhibited Dirty Corner at the Fabbrica del Vapore in Milan.[43] Having fully occupied the site's \"cathedral\" space, the work consists of a huge steel volume, 60 metres long and 8 metres high, that visitors enter. Inside, they gradually lose their perception of space, as it gets progressively darker and darker until there is no light, forcing people to use their other senses to guide them through the space. The entrance of the tunnel is goblet-shaped, featuring an interior and exterior surface that is circular, making minimal contact with the ground. Over the course of the exhibition, the work was progressively covered by some 160 cubic metres of earth by a large mechanical device, forming a sharp mountain of dirt which the tunnel appears to be running through. In 2016, his art exposition in MUAC (Mexico City) was a success, with literary contributions from Catherine Lampert, Cecilia Delgado, and Mexican writer Pablo Soler Frost.[44] Kapoor sued the National Rifle Association (NRA) in 2018. The gun lobby group had, without the sculptor's consent, used a filmed image of Cloud Gate in an approximately one-minute-long promotional video called \"The Violence of Lies\". The suit was ultimately settled out of court. Kapoor reported that the settlement included the removal of his work from the NRA's film, saying \"They have now complied with our demand to remove the unauthorized image of my sculpture Cloud Gate from their abhorrent video, which seeks to promote fear, hostility, and division in American society\".[45][46] Public commissions[edit] Turning the World Upside Down , Israel Museum , 2010.\nKapoor's earliest public commissions include the Cast Iron Mountain at the Tachikawa Art Project in Japan,[47] as well as an untitled 1995 piece installed at Toronto's Simcoe Place resembling mountain peaks. In 2001, Sky Mirror, a large mirror piece that reflects the sky and surroundings, was commissioned for a site outside the Nottingham Playhouse. Since 2006, Cloud Gate, a 110-ton stainless steel sculpture with a mirror finish, has been permanently installed in Millennium Park in Chicago. Viewers are able to walk beneath the sculpture and look up into an \"omphalos\" or navel above them. In the autumn of 2006, a second 10-metre Sky Mirror, was installed at Rockefeller Center, New York City. This work was later exhibited in Kensington Gardens in 2010 as part of the show Turning the World Upside Down, along with three other major mirror works.[6] ArcelorMittal Orbit.\n, London Olympic Park , 2012.\nIn 2009, Kapoor created the permanent, site-specific work Earth Cinema[48] for Pollino National Park, the largest national park in Italy, as part of the project ArtePollino – Another South.[49][50] Kapoor's work, Cinema di Terra (Earth Cinema), is a 45m long, 3m wide and 7m deep cut into the landscape made from concrete and earth.[49] People can enter from both sides and walk along it, viewing the earth void within.[50][51] Cinema di Terra officially opened to public in September 2009.[49] Kapoor was also commissioned by Tees Valley Regeneration (TVR) to produce five pieces of public art, collectively known as the Tees Valley Giants.[52] The first of these sculptures, Tememos, was unveiled to the public in June 2010. Temenos stands 50 metres high and is 110 metres in length. A steel wire mesh pulled taut between two enormous steel hoops, it remains an ethereal and an uncertain form despite its colossal scale. In 2010, Turning the World Upside Down, Jerusalem was commissioned and installed at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.  The sculpture is described as a \"16-foot tall polished-steel hourglass\" and it \"reflects and reverses the Jerusalem sky and the museum's landscape, a likely reference to the city's duality of celestial and earthly, holy and profane\".[53] The Greater London Authority selected Kapoor's Orbit sculpture from a shortlist of five artists as the permanent artwork for the Olympic Park of the 2012 Olympic Games.[8] At 115 metres tall, Orbit is the tallest sculpture in the UK. When asked if engagement with people and places is the key to successful public art, Kapoor said: I’m thinking about the mythical wonders of the world, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Tower of Babel. It’s as if the collective will comes up with something that has resonance on an individual level and so becomes mythic. I can claim to take that as a model for a way of thinking. Art can do it, and I’m going to have a damn good go. I want to occupy the territory, but the territory is an idea and a way of thinking as much as a context that generates objects. Architectural projects[edit] Throughout his career, Kapoor has worked extensively with architects and engineers. He says this body of work is neither pure sculpture nor pure architecture. His notable architectural projects include: Ark Nova , [54] an inflatable concert hall that will travel around the earthquake struck regions of Japan, designed in collaboration with architect Arata Isozaki .\n Orbit , [8] the permanent artwork for London’s Olympic Park, in collaboration with engineer Cecil Balmond .\n Temenos the first work of the Tees Valley Giants , the world's five largest sculptures, in collaboration with Cecil Balmond . Temenos [55] is situated in Middlehaven Dock, Middlesbrough.\n Dismemberment Site 1 , [56] installed in New Zealand at the Gibbs Farm sculpture park, owned by New Zealand businessman and art patron Alan Gibbs .\n 56 Leonard Street , [57] New York, in collaboration with architects Herzog and de Meuron .\n Two subway stations in Naples at Monte San Angelo [58] and Triano [59] in collaboration with Future Systems .\n Taratantara [33] (1999–2000) was installed at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art , Gateshead and later at Piazza Plebiscito, Naples.\n An unrealised project [60] for the Millennium Dome , London, (1995) in collaboration with Philip Gumuchdjian.\n Building for a Void, [61] created for Expo '92 , Seville , in collaboration with David Connor.\n Of his vision for the Cumana station in Monte Sant'Angelo, Naples, Italy under construction (as of June 2008[update]), Kapoor has said:  It’s very vulva-like. The tradition of the Paris or Moscow metro is of palaces of light, underground. I wanted to do exactly the opposite – to acknowledge that we are going underground. So it’s dark, and what I’ve done is bring the tunnel up and roll it over as a form like a sock.[62] Working with text[edit] In a collaboration with author Salman Rushdie, Kapoor conceived a sculpture consisting of two bronze boxes conjoined with red wax and inscribed around the outside with the first two paragraphs of Rushdie's text; \"Blood Relations\"[63] or an \"Interrogation of the Arabian Nights\" in 2006.[64] Stage design[edit] Kapoor has designed stage sets including for; the opera Idomeneo at Glyndebourne in 2003; Pelléas et Mélisande, La Monnaie in Brussels, and a dance-theatre piece called in-i with Akram Khan and Juliette Binoche at the National Theatre in London.[65] Anish Kapoor Foundation[edit] The Anish Kapoor Foundation was founded as a charity in 2017, registered in London. In early 2021, the Venice city council approved construction plans for the foundation to convert the Palazzo Priuli Manfrin into an exhibition venue, artist studio and repository for a number of the artist's works from the foundation's collection.[66] The project will be led by architecture firms FWR Associati of Venice and Studio Una of Hamburg.[66] Vantablack controversy[edit] In 2014 Kapoor began working with Vantablack, a substance thought to be one of the least reflective substances known. Vantablack S-VIS, a sprayable paint which uses randomly-aligned carbon nanotubes and only has high absorption in the visible light band, also called the \"blackest black\" colour, has been exclusively licensed to Anish Kapoor's studio for artistic use.[67] His exclusive license to the material has been criticized in the art world, but he has defended the agreement, saying: \"Why exclusive? Because it's a collaboration, because I am wanting to push them to a certain use for it. I've collaborated with people who make things out of stainless steel for years and that's exclusive.\"[68] Artists like Christian Furr and Stuart Semple have criticised Kapoor for what they perceive as an appropriation of a unique material, to the exclusion of others.[69][70] In retaliation, Semple developed a pigment called the \"pinkest pink\" and specifically made it available to everyone, except Anish Kapoor and anyone affiliated with him.[71][72] He later stated that the move was itself intended as something like performance art and that he did not anticipate the amount of attention it received.[73] In December 2016, Kapoor illegally obtained the pigment and posted an Image on Instagram of his extended middle finger which had been dipped in Semple's pink.[74] Semple developed more products such as \"Black 2.0\" and \"Black 3.0\", which to the human eyes looks nearly identical to Vantablack despite being acrylic, and \"Diamond Dust,\" an extremely reflective glitter made of glass shards, all of which were released with the same restriction against Kapoor as the \"pinkest pink\".[75][76] Exhibitions[edit] Kapoor initially began exhibiting as part of New British Sculpture art scene, along with fellow British sculptors Tony Cragg and Richard Deacon.[29] His first solo exhibition took place at Patrice Alexandra, Paris, in 1980.[77] He achieved widespread recognition when he represented Britain at the 1990 Venice Biennale,[78] and recounts the experience in Sarah Thornton's Seven Days in the Art World.[79] In 1992 Kapoor contributed to documenta IX with Building Descent into Limbo.[80] In 2004, he participated in The 5th Gwangju Biennale in Gwangju, Korea. Solo exhibitions of his work have since been held in the Tate and Hayward Gallery in London, Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland, Reina Sofia in Madrid, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Musée des arts contemporains (Grand-Hornu) in Belgium, the CAPC Museum of Contemporary Art in Bordeaux, the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil in Brazil, and the Guggenheim in Bilbao, New York City and Berlin. In 2008, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston held the first U.S. mid career survey of Kapoor's work.[81] That same year, Kapoor's Islamic Mirror (2008), a circular concave mirror, was installed in a 13th-century Arab palace now being used as by the Convent of Santa Clara in Murcia, Spain.[82] Kapoor was the first living British artist to take over the Royal Academy, London, in 2009;[83] the show attracted 275,000 visitors, rendering it at the time the most successful exhibition ever by a living artist held in London. Eventually it was overtaken by the more than 478,000 who attended the David Hockney exhibition at the Tate Modern in 2017.[84][85] This show subsequently travelled to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. In 2010, Kapoor retrospective exhibitions were held at the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) in New Delhi and Mumbai's Mehboob Studio, the first showcase of his work in the country of his birth.[86][87] In 2011 Kapoor had a solo touring exhibition with the Arts Council, part of their \"Flashback \" series of shows. In May he exhibited Leviathan at the Grand Palais, and two concurrent shows in Milan at the Rotonda della Besana and Fabbrica del Vapore.  He had a major exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (MCA) from December 2012 to April 2013 as part of the Sydney International Art Series.[88] Dirty Corner, exhibited at the Palace of Versailles in 2015, was a topic of controversy due to its \"blatantly sexual\" nature. Kapoor himself reportedly described the work as \"the vagina of a queen who is taking power\".[89] In 2020 Kapoor unveiled a new exhibition at the grounds of Houghton Hall in Norfolk. It was the largest ever outdoor exhibition of pieces by Kapoor, containing 21 sculptures, some previously unseen, as well as a selection of drawings of his.[90][91] From 2 October 2021 - 13 February 2022 an exhibition of works created during the pandemic - ‘Painting’ - was shown at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford. Collections[edit] Kapoor's work is collected worldwide, notably by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; Tate Modern in London; Fondazione Prada in Milan; the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; the Guggenheim in Bilbao; De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art in Tilburg, the Netherlands; the Moderna Museet, Stockholm; the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa, Japan; and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.[28] Personal life[edit] In 1995, Kapoor married German-born medieval art historian Susanne Spicale.[92] They have a daughter Alba and a son Ishan[24] and lived in a house designed by architect Tony Fretton in Chelsea, London.[93][94] In 2009, Kapoor purchased a 14,500 sq ft (1,350 m2) Georgian-style residence at Lincoln's Inn Fields for about £3.6 million and had it redesigned by David Chipperfield.[95] The couple separated and divorced in 2013. Kapoor has since been in a relationship with garden designer Sophie Walker and the two married in 2016 (or early 2017).[2] Awards and honours[edit] Artistic accolades 1990 Premio Duemila , Venice Biennale.\n1991 Turner Prize.\n1999 elected Royal Academician [28].\n2011 Praemium Imperiale [96].\nCivilian honours 2003 Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\n2011 French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\n2012 Padma Bhushan , India's third-highest civilian honour.

He is well known for his sociologically engaged works that often discuss youth politics, accessibility and democracy.[1][2] Semple's work has strong links with Richard Hamilton's Pop Art, but has a contemporary emphasis on latent fear and threat rather than Hamilton's consumer culture and glamour.[3] Contents 1 Life and career.\n2 Philosophy.\n3 Conflict with Anish Kapoor.\n4 Activism.\n5 Early career.\n6 Later works.\n7 Curatorial projects.\n8 References.\n9 External links.\nLife and career[edit] Semple was born in Bournemouth, Dorset. He studied Advanced Art and Design at Bournemouth and Poole College, and Painting and Printmaking at Bretton Hall College[1][4] in Yorkshire. Semple speaks about the inspiration from his grandfather whose memory inspired a jumper Semple designed.[5] Semple's mother also took him to the National Gallery and he described that moment being the main catalyst in becoming an artist when he saw Van Gogh's Sunflowers aged 7.[6][7] In 2004, art dealer Anthony d'Offay flew his portfolio to New York and persuaded him to move to London.[8] A 2007 solo exhibition saw $1 million sales within the first five minutes[9] and a recent London exhibition had presales to a Foundation of $1 million.[10] In 2010 Semple disclosed in an interview with The Evening Standard he had had a sudden near death experience in 2000 following an allergic reaction. Semple referenced the event in an artwork painted that year; \"This is the flatline of my ECG showing where I officially died, my vital signs zeroed completely.\"[9] Semple identifies the experience as being the catalyst that motivated him to dedicate his life to making art.[11][12] In 1999 Semple became one of the first artists to utilise the Internet and the potential of digital and created an early online community on eBay who followed drawings he posted up each night.[13][14]  Semple's continual appropriation of digital mediums put him in The Guardian's Ten Best Art Auctions alongside Damien Hirst, Ai Weiwei and Edvard Munch.[15] In 2012 Semple was the first visual artist to release a body of work on iTunes called \"EXIT\"[16] that was commissioned to be a fully digital experience.[17] His desire to create and distribute this series via iTunes was so that it could be directly accessed affordably in every household worldwide which built on his exploration of the internet and accessibility to contemporary art.[18][19][20][21] The digital artwork \"The Effect\" which was exhibited during the Suspend Disbelief exhibition is viewable and possible to own on Sedition.[22] Semple is quoted in The Art Newspaper \"Instagram is such a direct medium\" as a way for artists to share their work in an article about how social media can become a new exhibition space.[23] In 2015, Semple created a new series of 5 browser based artworks as websites and offered each site for sale on eBay to create a way for digital art to be simply viewed, bought and sold using hosting.[24] On the eve of the 2010 general election, the BBC spent the day reporting live from Semple's studio and opening night of his \"Happy House\" exhibition. The narrative in the collection of works was seen as a prediction and warning of how the country could be affected by the financial situation and policies towards culture.[25][26] The opening of \"Anxiety Generation\" in London in 2014 was reported by Tatler as \"just like being at the Brit Awards in the Nineties\".[27] The Art Newspaper reported Semple signed with Next Management in 2013 alongside working with galleries.[28] The Art Newspaper continue debating the traditional gallery model and discuss how dealers and galleries place Semple works in important collections but also the agents and management that handle copyright and licensing.[23] In January 2012 Semple opened the new North Light Centre for Art and Design at Bournemouth & Poole College and judges a yearly competition of the student's works. Semple has spoken at  The ICA,[19][29] The Institute of Ideas,[30] CultureLabel,[31] Amnesty,[32] Jerwood Visual Arts for his digital activity,[33] and for DACS on digital and copyright topics. in 2005, Semple was the youngest member appointed to the Design and Artists Copyright Society creators' council. Semple has featured on the BBC in 2009 for Blue Peter[34] and in 2011[35] and 2014 he presented for the BBC's Art & Design series[36]  where he talks about Inspiration[37] Tools & Tips[38] and Idea to Art.[39] In 2013, Semple created Jump[40] for Australia's Federation Square's public art programme, a 10 x 10m bouncy cloud, and in 2014, Semple represented the British Program for The Night at The Museum festival, releasing thousands of HappyClouds over Moscow.[41] This public art performance has so far also been held in London, Italy, Ireland and Australia. In 2013 Semple received a medal at The House Of Lords for the UN's first International Day of Happiness and nominated Marilena Borgna and May Gabriel also as his Happiness Heros[42] and spoke to The Independent about the secret to happiness: \"My son makes me truly happy... Happiness from real things and from flash things are worlds apart.\"[43] \"My Happy Colouring Flip Book\" was published in 2015 as an anti-stress, creative therapy colouring book for adults by Semple and to raise funds for the Mind creative therapies fund.[44] Philosophy[edit] Stuart Semple, HappyClouds Semple has sent \"Happy Clouds\" up into the sky over London initially in direct response to the recession and also in a bid to highlight and spread happiness worldwide, being invited to repeat the artwork in Dublin, Moscow, Australia and Milan.[45][46] \"I know at times like this it's easy to make creativity a low priority, but I want to show on a very human level that an artistic idea might be able to do something important, even for a fleeting moment.\"[47][48][49][50] \"I don't see why we couldn't spread the happy clouds around the world a bit.\"[51][52] Large scale positive public artworks around this theme of happiness has included \"Jump\", where Melbourne's Federation Square was transformed into an open air white cloud-like trampoline that invited adults to join in.[53] In 2016 \"Something Amazing\", was held in 6 cities in England and Scotland, who found giant coloured helium balloon sculptures dotted through streets at sunrise, and encouraged people to take and share screenprinted balloons which featured artwork of his yet to be born nephew. The work was discussed by Matilda Battersby in The Independent in context artists including Frida Kahlo, Tracy Emin and Semple tackling the taboo subject of infertility.[54] Eric Bryant debated Semple and contemporary Pop Art in a seminal ARTnews feature 50 years after Richard Hamilton had defined the movement. \"While earlier generations of Pop artists exhibited a similar love-hate relationship with consumer culture and glamour, this group takes on fear and violence.\"[55] Semple's relationship with current culture, politics and imagery has put him at the forefront of the next generation of debate, where artists now tackle the current climate of fear; \"his often disturbing, even sinister works also feature guns, pills, and frequent references to suicide.\"[55] In being categorised within Pop Art, Aidan Duane debated in The Irish Times how his work brings it up to date.[50] There is a real intelligence at the heart of his art. On the one hand he clearly embraces the throwaway, famous-for-15-minutes soundbite culture of celebrity and distraction. On the other, he stops it in its tracks, recasting its giddy imagery in the slow, fixed medium of paint. He might seem to celebrate it, but he actually doesn't quite trust the world of mass production and communications. His work implies a conviction that there is, or perhaps there better be, something genuine, something real, beyond the glam facade of throwaway culture. In Vogue Italia Stuart Semple discusses his critical relationship with Pop culture in a post Warhol society where it has become a universal language but aims to act removed.[56] Semple discussed in his Guardian blog the influence of growing up in the 1980s and how that period is vital for our art, seeing \"youth culture was a powerful force, bright, seductive and ultimately a lot less hollow\". He comments about the rise of the new advertising class that has been replacing our social connections after Thatcherism by \"associating products with personal empowerment\" which was brought about by \"a time of intense atomisation and individualisation to the detriment of community caused a pop cultural language centered around nurturing the ego.\"[57] Topics of youth apathy were touched upon in 2014's \"Anxiety Generation\" exhibition where Semple debated that a risk industry keeps our current generation in a passive state of fear and consumption, not having a war or threat of nuclear destruction that our parents faced, but he feels \"There is a misconception that the youth are apathetic, that they sit around playing on their Xboxes and are all connected digitally, not with the rest of the living world. I can't think of anything more active than going out and rioting,\"[58] In 2013, Semple talked to Josh Spero about his career and influences as part of The ICA's Culture Now series.[19] In 2007, when interviewed for Trebuchet Magazine, Semple described how his early experience of pop influenced his approach to art \"When I was growing up in the 80s these things (cultural icons) were – I don't know if it's quite right to say they were aspirational, but they certainly gave me my first feelings of something larger. But as you get older you get more jaded so now when you look back at these 'nostalgic' things, you have lost something. Here I've tried to look at them again in such as way as to rediscover that sense of feeling\"[59] In 2013, the Suspend Disbelief exhibition wanted the public to question their relationship with reality and the way we all, in a multitude of ways, suspend belief to survive; that in order to be fully entertained by a movie or a magic trick or certain kinds of media, you need to pause your belief in it as a fiction; the idea that in order to live at all we need to suspend our disbelief in the fact we are dying.[60][61] Semple discusses his practice towards making exhibition like that of a musical recording artist on the BBC[36] and also in a conversation with Indechs[20] Painting in a way is like a recording of a moment, a live moment, where you were what you did, how you physically moved your body. A music recording is the same. I can think of a series of paintings that go together like an album, that make thematic sense that sit together, that's useful for me. I can get a little phrase, or a hook or a melody in my mind. It's an image idea though and I live with that and churn it over, I might draw it or just remember, then I'll get in the studio and put it down. Sometimes I make a little study, I guess that's like a musicians demo of a song. Then I work them into bigger finished things. Collaging is the same as musical sampling. Layers in a painting are like layers in a mix. In an interview with Doug McClemont he refers to the mimetic industries of mass-production; which has been a running critique in Semple's work. He discussed the \"idea of taking the mechanization out the pop stuff. Because I find a lot of it non-emotive.\"[62]  He also alluded more to his studio practice;  \"I used to paint alone when I had a tiny studio middle of nowhere. It had mice and was freezing. Now I have assistants who help me paint, because I'm doing massive, massive stuff, right now. It's not the same...\"[62]  In 2014 he discussed his studio routine with The Irish Times explaining how he preferred to be more solitary but market pressures had dictated him to expand his studio.[50][63] His studio was documented during BBC filming in 2011 and 2014.[64] In 2014 the solo exhibition \"Anxiety Generation\" takes a snap shot of contemporary culture and communication. \"My generation is the fulcrum for decades of anxiety and we have been made so inert and fearful that we dare not even face it to understand what it is.\"[65] Reviewed in Trebuchet \"Where previous generations contended with the death of god as a surety, Semple's work contends with information and self in the same way... Semple is suggesting that reality and fantasy are undifferentiated in how society sees and acts. The representational world, the virtual world, is as real as it can get for Westerners trying to make sense of a flickering reality that mirrors through generalities and stereotypes.[66] Reviewed in Candid Magazine \"Here is an artist concerned with the idea of shaking the population out of lethargy and asking the difficult questions like why does it take a war or other major disaster to get us talking to our neighbours and connecting as a community? A sentiment depicted with unflinching bluntness in Technicolour Hiroshima (2014), his use of Morrissey lyrics \"[...] the bomb that will bring us together\" literally spelling out our failing as a community. Semple uses snippets, scenes and headlines from all manner of popular culture to relate to the viewer and draw them into the conversation.\"[67] Conflict with Anish Kapoor[edit] Semple came into conflict with the artist Anish Kapoor when Kapoor purchased exclusive artistic rights to the 'world's blackest' material, Vantablack, in 2016. Vantablack is made of microscopic stems of carbon that are 300 times as tall as they are wide, so that 99.6% of all light gets trapped in the network of stems. The material was being developed for scientific and military use because of its masking ability. It has the potential to hide stealth aircraft; and block out stray light reflections inside powerful telescopes, enabling them to see faint astronomical objects.[68] After purchasing the rights to Vantablack in 2016, Kapoor faced a backlash from the artist community. Artist Christian Furr commented that he had \"never heard of an artist monopolising a material. All the best artists have had a thing for pure black – Turner, Manet, Goya ... This black is like dynamite in the art world. We should be able to use it. It isn't right that it belongs to one man.\"[68] Semple positioned himself at the forefront of this backlash when he released PINK – the world's pinkest pink paint – in retaliation. Semple explicitly banned Kapoor from buying the paint, stating that \"We all remember kids at school who wouldn't share their colouring pencils, but then they ended up on their own with no friends. It's cool, Anish can have his black. But the rest of us will be playing with the rainbow!\"[69] Purchasers of PINK are required to make a legal declaration during the online checkout process, confirming that: \"you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make its way into that hands of Anish Kapoor.\"[69] Kapoor managed to acquire the pigment and on his Instagram account posted a picture showing his middle finger dipped in PINK, with the caption \"Up yours #pink.\"[70] Semple responded by describing Kapoor as \"some kind of end-of-game super baddie\" who \"should be old enough to know better\" after Kapoor's Instagram post.[71] Roisin O'Connor writing for The Independent called it \"one of the most spectacular displays of pettiness\" ... \"these are two grown men fighting over who gets to use the pretty colours.\"[72] On 3 February 2017 Semple hit back at Kapoor with the release of his own version of Vantablack, dubbed \"Better Black\".[71] Semple admits that the paint is not perfect, but says it is better because it is affordable and available to everyone.[73] \"Better Black\" comes as a pigment and an acrylic \"super-base\" which when combined replicates the light-absorbing technology of Vantablack.[73]  Black 2.0 followed on 30 March 2017. Since then, Semple's Culture Hustle has released a Black 3.0,[74] and \"Diamond Dust\", described as the world's \"most glittery glitter\" (equally forbidden to Kapoor).[75] Activism[edit] Semple has supported Amnesty International and has created artworks for the Freedom of Expression Campaign. \"There are more artists living in East London than in the whole of Renaissance Italy and we're doing all sorts of weird and wonderful things every day,\" he pointed out, \"but there are other people all over the world who don't have the privilege of being able to say what they think.\"[76] He also spoke for Amnesty about positive mental health being a Human Right alongside Joe Pantoliano and Colm O'Gorman during Ireland's \"First Fortnight\" arts festival.[77] Stuart Semple A POUNDING OUTSIDE POUNDLAND (or how my nose got its wonk) 2010 In 2010 Semple spoke for the first time about how his life changed after a near death experience a decade earlier. \"Up until that day I was a normal kid, I went to art school, I was like everyone else ... Then I had this awful week when I had a huge allergic reaction, my tongue swelled up so big I could hardly breathe and I found myself in a hospital bed, dying.\"[9] 2011 Semple was made an Ambassador for mental health charity Mind.[78] He initiated the Creative Therapies fund within the organisation which he launched with Stephen Fry and Melvyn Bragg and curated the exhibition & auction \"Mindful\"[79] that included works from Jake & Dinos Chapman, Mat Collishaw, Tracey Emin, Mona Hatoum, Sarah Lucas and Sebastian Horsley.[80] Semple recently created a whole body of work and short film for a solo booth at London's ART13[81] with all proceeds in aid of the Mind Creative Therapies fund[82]  For Mind's Time To Change campaign he designed a series of well wishing e-cards and temporary tattoos[83] \"My Happy Place\" was a citywide exhibition in Coventry that coincided with 2015 World Mental Health Day and saw live events, film, food, art and sculpture initiated and created by Semple with Coventry's The Pod collective. Semple's Happy Place consisted of a Unicorn shaped spinning disco mirror ball.[84] The Creative Therapies fund has backed projects nationwide since 2012 and has stepped in to save some groups where local government funding had been cut. Semple talks about his understanding in a Mind interview \"...Often those suffering find it hard to express their feelings with words, but being creative in a proper therapeutic environment with trained therapists is a very powerful path to healing. The results are phenomenal I meet and hear from so many people who literally tell me creative therapy has changed their lives so I'm on a real mission to help people understand that and to spread it as far as I can\".[85][86] Semple was vocal about the Arts Cuts imposed following the recession making an artwork \"The First Cut\" which was exhibited in Hong Kong as part of \"The British Cut\" exhibition, showcasing major contemporary artists latest work and pictured the scene from the demonstration. His 2010 exhibition \"Happy House\" opened on the eve of the General Election and the opening was broadcast live on the BBC[25] with the works addressing fears of a future where creativity is overlooked.[26][87] Semple spoke in The Guardian \"I believe that society and its institutions should be doing much more to encourage young people to follow their dreams – helping them to avoid a future of missed opportunity and regret\"[88] and in The Huffington Post \"The creative industries are a massive contributing factor to our economy and across all those fields we desperately need new dreamers.\"[89] Semple has appeared on BBC art shows mentoring students, talking about his techniques and inviting them to visit his studio.[64] Semple met with Vince Cable to discuss the impact on artists lives with proposed changes to Artists Resale Right so lower priced sales still counted as it make a difference to younger artists, also for the royalty to pass to their children, saying \"The art world should be trying to support and nurture subsequent generations of talent.\"[90][91][92][93] He spoke to the Student Handbook about this \"The creative industries count towards a huge proportion of our economy, it's something like 16% which is nearly as much as banking. It's short-sighted of the government to put these cuts in place because as a country we are extremely creative, whether it's advertising, graphic design, film making, fashion; we lead in all these fields\".[94] Semple supported MTV Re:Define exhibition at The Goss-Michael Foundation in 2011 with auction proceeds donated to MTV Staying Alive Foundation which enables inspirational youngsters to fight HIV and AIDS in their local communities. He has also supported the Africa Foundation via Art for Africa with Sotheby's, Macmillan De'Longhi Art Auction at Bonhams and the medical foundation Freedom from Torture's art auction where he talks to Claire Hazelton \"Art is one of the most powerful things we've got. It does really work, beyond fundraising.\"[95][96] In 2011 Semple was featured on postcards for the Anaphylaxis campaign. Semple featured his work \"Nimrod\" in the AKA Peace exhibition curated by Jake Chapman with The ICA in 2012 for Peace One Day.[97][98][99] \"Deep House Music\" was painted for the Articulate exhibition held at Victoria Miro Gallery in 2013 in direct response to moving children's testimony recorded in South Africa and Rwanda, in aid of children's art charity Dramatic Need.[100] Early career[edit] Semple spoke to David Hayes about his early years \"Growing up in the 1990s in Bournemouth I was into indie style – I wore checked trousers and jumpers that were too baggy and had holes in them. Grungy, but in a naff sort of way. The group Placebo were a big inspiration. Brian Molko was amazing; it was as much about how he looked as what he sang. I used to travel up to Harvey Nichols in London and buy Hard Candy nail varnish...I don't think my style is that outrageous but people beep their car horns at me or shout out of the window.\"[1] Semple mentions his motivation growing up in a small town devoid of culture with just neighbouring extremes of entrepreneurs or rough neighbourhoods and his self-education over three years reading in Borders every morning.[101] Semple took the persona of \"Nancyboy\" after his near death experience and produced over 3000 works of art between 1999 and 2003 that were sold via eBay each night at a set time creating an early online community and becoming one of the first artists to utilise the internet in their work.[13][14] In 2002 he had his first major London solo exhibition at the A&D Gallery.[5][102] It was called Stolen Language – the art of Nancyboy. It incorporated fragments and images that he identified with in popular culture and remixed into a personal narrative consisting of large paintings, screen prints, sculptures, T-shirts and panels.[103] 10 final \"nancyboys\" were created in 2009 and auctioned once again via eBay with all proceeds donated to the UK charity Mind after his grandmother became diagnosed with schizophrenia.[50][104] The Nancyboy Decade exhibition was organised by the original collectors who exhibited their early drawings and canvases commemorate to the 10 years.[105] Debbie Harry bought her first Semple painting in 2004, he suggested the same price of $200 she had paid for her first Basquiat canvas in memory of this.[106] Semple was commissioned to create a memorial with debris collected from the 2004 Momart warehouse fire.[8]  Semple packaged them in 8 plastic boxes under the title Burn Baby Burn. The boxes were then painted over and had slogans in pink lettering, including \"RIP YBA\", which referred to the Young British Artists, by whom much of the destroyed work had been created. Semple stated that amongst the debris collected there were fragments of Tracey Emin's artwork, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 (\"the tent\").[107] In 2005 Semple produced an exhibition of his works in an abandoned Docklands warehouse in East London, called Post Pop Paradise. Also that year he included a painting into the Saatchi Gallery  which included the words \"British Painting Still Rocks\" as reaction to Charles Saatchi's comments that the YBA artists would be nothing more than a footnote in the history of art.[108][109][110][111] In 2006 Semple's exhibition \"Epiphany\" at Martin Summers Fine Art in London questioned the role of religion in modern life[112] in a series of in-your-face paintings that alluded to popular culture, graphic media, advertising and social issues.[113] Later works[edit] Semple, photographed with \"Kurt Lied\" In 2007 Semple exhibited \"Fake Plastic Love\", an exhibition of billboard scale paintings housed within a blacked out environment of East London's Truman Brewery.[2] In 2009 he held his first New York solo exhibition \"Everlasting Nothing Less\" at Anna Kustera Gallery involving large scale paintings and sculpture which also toured London and Milan.[114] Semple's \"The Happy House\" series of paintings built upon the themes explored in earlier collections of fears about his generation, as well as commentary on the artifice of media obsession, politics and disappointment. For the first time he touched on more personal narratives as well as current cultural and political issues. His self-portrait 'A Pounding Outside Poundland' captured the moment Semple was assaulted.[87] He told Esquire \"I feel I have been analysing popular culture from outside itself by using its own languages\".[115] The solo exhibition \"It's Hard To Be A Saint In This City\" in Hong Kong heavily featured text in and on sculptures, exploring poetry and song lyrics of adolescent dreaming and isolation.[7][116] Solo exhibition \"Suspend Disbelief\" (2013) in London explored ideas of superstition and illusion.[117] Semple created an immersive exploratory environment with film, paintings and sculpture throughout 15 rooms, where magic tricks were performed by holograms, childhood experiences revisited and he questioned the cycle of life and death within a projection dome where hundreds of flowers perpetually bloom in time lapse. \"It's like life without any death because they never wilt.\"[60][118] \"Anxiety Generation\" (2014) at Delahunty Gallery on Bruton Street was reviewed in Modern Painters by Jonathan R Jones who likened the series to John Carpenter's film \"They Live\" and referencing Heidegger and Derrida in context of the erasure of text used by Semple \"words in his paintings (\"too high, too far, too soon,\" \"cool aid,\" and \"Froot Loops\") are frequently crossed out, suggesting their inability to convey meaning\", and commends the achievement to cut through our cynicism and give images again the power to disturb with his use paint where horror images have been immortalised out of the faster moving social media image world that can see society numb to continual rolling images of war and disaster.[citation needed] \"My Sonic Youth\" (2015) held in Fabien Castanier Gallery, Los Angeles, talks about the cultural shift that teenagers have seen in the decades since Kurt Cobain's death. Speaking to Hunger, Semple is quoted: \"I hate to be pessimistic but if I'm honest I feel really worried about it. The gap between rich and poor is going to become colossal. Systems of surveillance and control are going to become even more perverse. Physical spaces and virtual ones will continue to become inverted to a point where more life is lived virtually than physically. The level of online surveillance will increase in proportion to the growing level of fear in the population. Initially, this will look like freedom and this fake freedom will cause a shift in the dominant ideologies. Our value system will change until safety is top of our list and our belief in risk and threat will be unwavering. Atomised, individualistic egoism will grow and continue to be temporarily satisfied by shopping. We will become increasingly distanced from history. Counter-cultural voices within the arts will become commodified faster and faster and therefore [be rendered] inert. Our self-identity will become more fluid through use of online avatar and selfie-shaping tools and apps. The result of that will be our true physical selves will become more unloved and we'll feel empty. Profits from anti-depressants will rise.\"[119] Curatorial projects[edit] In 2007, Semple co-curated and featured in the 'Black Market' at the Anna Kustera gallery in New York with Just Another Rich Kid.  Showcasing their collaborative installation piece 'Team Dream Chaos' depicting a provocative teenage girl's bedroom.[62] Semple has curated exhibitions \"Mash Ups, post pop fragments and détournements\" at The Kowalsky Gallery in 2008 for the Design and Artists Copyright Society[120][121] and 'London Loves The Way Things Fall Apart' (2009) and \"This Is England\" (2011) for Galleria Aus18, Milan.[122] Semple's exploration of British cultural themes have also been seen in the exhibition \"This Is England\" (2010) initially held at The Aubin Gallery (which he directed in association with Aubin & Wills and Shoreditch House) featuring artists Sarah Maple, Nicky Carvell, David Hancock and Richard Galloway which then toured to Milan.[123] In 2011 Semple curated the Mindful exhibition in 25,000 sqft Old Vic Tunnels featuring artists including Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tracey Emin, Mona Hatoum, Mat Collishaw, Sebastian Horsley, Sarah Lucas, Barney Bubbles, Liliane Lijn, Tessa Farmer and Semple. It coincided with a gala dinner at The Imperial War Museum hosted by Stephen Fry and Lord Melvyn Bragg to raise funds for the Mind creative therapies fund and explore the relationship between creativity and mental health.[124][125] References[edit] ^ a b c.\nHayes, David (2013).

Sky Mirror is a 6-metre-wide (20 ft)-wide concave dish of polished stainless steel weighing 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons) and angled up towards the sky. Its surface reflects the ever-changing environment. It took six years from the initial idea for a major new piece of public art to the unveiling of Sky Mirror on 27 April 2001, and cost £900,000.[1] At the time, it was the most expensive piece of civic art funded by the National Lottery.[citation needed] It was manufactured in Finland. In autumn 2007 the Nottingham Playhouse Sky Mirror was voted Pride of Place in a poll to find Nottingham's favourite landmark.[citation needed] More recently,[when?] Sky Mirror has been installed in Brighton's Pavilion Gardens for the Brighton Festival. From 19 September to 27 October 2006, a larger version of Sky Mirror was installed at Rockefeller Center in New York City. It had a 35 foot (11 m) diameter, stood three stories tall, and weighed 23 long tons (23 t).[2][citation needed] The convex side faced Fifth Avenue, the concave side the Rockefeller Center courtyard. Versions of Sky Mirror also exist in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in front of the Casino de Monte-Carlo in Monaco and in the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art in Tilburg, the Netherlands.[citation needed] From 28 September 2010, Sky Mirror and three other Kapoor sculptures were exhibited in Kensington Gardens, London.[3] The open-air exhibition was titled Turning the World Upside Down and it ran until 13 March 2011. It was accessible from 6 a.m. until dusk.[4] Kapoor said that Kensington Gardens was \"the best site in London for a piece of art, probably in the world\". The location of Sky Mirror was previously occupied by a sculpture by Henry Moore – a work that was donated by the artist, but had been removed for conservation in 1996.[5] Kapoor's sculptures are guarded round-the-clock at a cost estimated to be £120,000 paid for by the Royal Parks Agency.[6][needs update?] Sky Mirror's permanent installation is at Dallas Cowboys Art Collection at AT&T Stadium.[7] Gallery[edit] Sky Mirror, Nottingham Sky Mirror, Kensington Gardens, London Sky Mirror, New York, as seen from Rockefeller Center.\nReferences[edit] ^ a b.\nYoung, Emma. \"Barbecue wings\" .

It is Britain's largest piece of public art,[3] and is intended to be a permanent lasting legacy of London's hosting of the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, assisting in the post-Olympics regeneration of the Stratford area. Sited between the Olympic Stadium (now called London Stadium) and the Aquatics Centre, it allows visitors to view the whole Olympic Park from two observation platforms. Orbit was designed by Turner-Prize winning artist Anish Kapoor and Cecil Balmond of Arup Group, an engineering firm. Announced on 31 March 2010, it was expected to be completed by December 2011. The project came about after Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell decided in 2008 that the Olympic Park needed \"something extra\". Designers were asked for ideas for an \"Olympic tower\" at least 100 metres (330 ft) high: Orbit was the unanimous choice from proposals considered by a nine-person advisory panel. Kapoor and Balmond believed that Orbit represented a radical advance in the architectural field of combining sculpture and structural engineering, and that it combined both stability and instability in a work that visitors can engage with and experience via an incorporated spiral walkway. It has been both praised and criticised for its bold design, and has especially received criticism as a vanity project of questionable lasting use or merit as a public art project. The project was expected to cost £19.1 million, with £16 million coming from Britain's then-richest man, the steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman of the ArcelorMittal steel company, and the balance of £3.1 million coming from the London Development Agency. The name \"ArcelorMittal Orbit\" combines the name of Mittal's company, as chief sponsor, with Orbit, the original working title for Kapoor and Balmond's design. The ArcelorMittal Orbit temporarily closed after the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games while the South Plaza (in which Orbit is positioned) underwent reconstruction for its long-term legacy use as a public outdoor space. It re-opened to the public on 5 April 2014. The structure incorporates the world's tallest and longest – 178 m (584 ft) – tunnel slide, designed by Carsten Höller. The idea was originally envisioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation as a way to attract more visitors to the tower. The slide includes transparent sections to give a \"different perspective\" of the twisting red tower and was completed in June 2016. This follows an option to abseil down the tower, introduced in 2014.

It received about 50 submissions.[5] Johnson has said that his early concept for the project was something more modest than Orbit, along the lines of \"a kind of 21st-century Trajan's Column\", but this was dropped when more daring ideas were received.[4] The media reported unconfirmed details of the project in October 2009, describing the interest of the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, one of Britain's richest men, in funding a project that would cost around £15 million. Boris Johnson was believed to want something like the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty.[6][7] At that time there were understood to be five artists being considered, including Antony Gormley.[6] Early designs reportedly included 'Transmission' by Paul Fryer, a 400-foot (120 m) high structure \"resembling a cross between a pylon and a native American totem pole\", according to The Times.[6] A spokesman for Johnson would only confirm that he was \"keen to see stunning, ambitious, world-class art in the Olympic Park\", and that work on commissioning the project was at an early stage.[6][7] Mittal's involvement came about after a chance meeting with Johnson in a cloakroom in Davos in January 2009,[8] as they were on their way to separate dinner engagements. In a conversation that reportedly lasted 45 seconds Johnson pitched the idea to Mittal, who immediately agreed to supply the steel.[4] Mittal later said of his involvement, \"I never expected that this was going to be such a huge project. I thought it was just the supply of some steel, a thousand tonnes or so, and that would be it. But then we started working with artists and I realised that the object was not just to supply steel but to complete the whole project. It took us almost 15 months of negotiation and discussion.\"[9] Johnson has said that, \"In reality, ArcelorMittal has given much more than the steel.\"[4] Kapoor's and Balmond's Orbit was announced as the winner on 31 March 2010.[10] According to The Guardian, Orbit was chosen from a short list of three, beating a design by Antony Gormley and one by the architectural firm Caruso St John.[11] According to The Times, Gormley's design was a 390-foot (120 m) steel colossus titled Olympian Man, a trademark piece of a statue of himself, rejected mainly on the grounds of its projected cost, estimated at £40 million.[12] Johnson and Jowell agreed to issue a commission for Orbit in partnership with Mittal after it was chosen by a nine-person advisory panel brought together by them to advise on a long list of proposals.[4][10] According to Mittal, the panel made a unanimous decision to pick Orbit, as it both represented the Olympic Games and was achievable within the ambitious time frame.[5] Kapoor described it as \"the commission of a lifetime\".[10] Johnson pre-empted possible criticism during the official launch by stating: \"Of course some people will say we are nuts – in the depths of a recession – to be building Britain’s biggest ever piece of public art. But both Tessa Jowell and I are certain that this is the right thing for the Stratford site, in Games time and beyond.\"[4] The completed structure was officially unveiled to the press and public on 11 May 2012.[13] An image of the structure was included in the 2015 design of the British passport.[14][15] The structure was re-purposed with the world's longest slide in 2016, as a way to attract more visitors.[16] Design[edit] Audio description of ArcelorMittal Orbit by Mike Brace.\nInterpretation[edit] According to Kapoor, the design brief from the Mayor's office was for a \"tower of at least 100 metres (330 ft)\", while Balmond said that he was told the Mayor was \"looking for an icon to match the Eiffel Tower\".[17] Kapoor said that one of the influences on his design was the Tower of Babel, the sense of \"building the impossible\" that \"has something mythic about it\", and that the form \"straddles Eiffel and Tatlin\".[17] Balmond, working on the metaphor of an orbit, envisaged an electron cloud moving, to create a structure that appears unstable, propping itself up, \"never centred, never quite vertical\".[17] Both believe that Orbit represents a new way of thinking, \"a radical new piece of structure and architecture and art\" that uses non-linearity – the use of \"instabilities as stabilities.\"[17] The spaces inside the structure, in between the twisting steel, are \"cathedral like\", according to Balmond, while according to Kapoor, the intention is that visitors will engage with the piece as they wind \"up and up and in on oneself\" on the spiral walkway.[17] The Independent described Orbit as \"a continuously looping lattice ... made up of eight strands winding into each other and combined by rings like a jagged knot\". The Guardian describes it as a \"giant lattice tripod sporting a counterweight collar around its neck designed to offset the weight of its head, a two-storey dining and viewing gallery\". According to the BBC, the design incorporates the five Olympic rings.[18][19][20] Upon its launch Johnson said \"It would have boggled the minds of the Romans. It would have boggled Gustave Eiffel.\"[18] Nicholas Serota, a member of the design panel, said that Orbit was a tower with an interesting twist, with \"the energy you might traditionally associate with this type of structure but in a surprisingly female form\".[21] According to Mittal, Orbit was already the working title, as it describes continuous action, a creative representation of the \"extraordinary physical and emotional effort\" that Olympians undertake in their continuous drive to do better. It was decided to keep this as the final name and prepend ArcelorMittal (as the project supporter).[5] On the public announcement of the design Johnson conceded that it might become known by something other than its official name, suggesting \"Colossus of Stratford\" or the \"Hubble Bubble\", in reference to his belief that it resembles a giant shisha pipe, or a variant on people's perceptions that it resembled a \"giant treble clef\", a \"helter-skelter\", or a \"supersized mutant trombone\".[11] Designers[edit] Orbit is described as \"designed by Anish Kapoor and Cecil Balmond\".[22] Kapoor is a Turner Prize winning sculptor, while Balmond is one of the world's leading designers. According to Kapoor, both men are \"interested in a place where architecture meets sculpture\" and \"the way that form and geometry give rise to structure\".[23] Kapoor and Balmond stated that their interests have blurred and crossed over into each other's fields since they first began working together in 2002 on Kapoor's Marsyas installation in the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern.[23] As well as Orbit, in 2010 Kapoor and Balmond were also working on the Tees Valley Giants, a public art project in northern England.[23] The sculpture was engineered by the Global engineer Arup, who developed the overall geometry, structural design and the building services including the lighting displayed extensively during the Olympic games.[24] Architectural input by Kathryn Findlay (Ushida Findlay Architects, as a sub-consultant to Arup) made the sculpture into a functional building, for example designing the staircase.[2][25] Structural[edit] The ArcelorMittal Orbit during the 2012 Summer Olympics .\n The organic design of Orbit demanded an extraordinary amount of structural engineering work. This was done by Arup, which reported that it took up two-thirds of the budget for the project (twice the percentage normally allotted to structural engineering in a building project).[26] From a structural point of view, Orbit consists of two parts:[26] the trunk – the more-or-less vertical tower which houses the elevators and stairs and supports the observation deck .\n the red tube – an open lattice of red steel that surrounds the trunk.\n The trunk has a base diameter of 37 metres (121 ft), narrowing to 5 metres (16 ft) on the way up, then widening again to 9.6 metres (31 ft) just under the observation deck.[26] The trunk is supported and stabilized by the tube, which gives a structural character of a tripod to the entire construction.[26] Further structural integrity is given to the construction by octagonal steel rings that surround the tube and trunk, spaced at 4 metres (13 ft) and cross-joined pairwise by sixteen diagonally mounted steel connectors.[26] A special part of the construction is the canopy, the conic shape that hangs off the bottom of the trunk. Originally planned as a fibreglass composite construction, costs forced the use of steel for this section as well. Centraalstaal was approached as a special consultant for the design of the steel cone and came up with a design for a cone built out of 117 individually shaped steel panels with a total surface area of 586 square metres. The entire cone weighs 84 tonnes.[26] Height[edit] Early contradictory reports suggested the tower would be 120 metres (390 ft) tall.[11][27][28][29] However, it finally measured in at 114.5 metres (376 ft) making it the UK's tallest [30] sculpture,[31] surpassing the 60-metre (200 ft) tall Aspire. The Greater London Authority on announcing the project described Orbit's height in comparison with the Statue of Liberty, stating that it would be 22 metres (72 ft) taller[10] – the Statue of Liberty is 93 metres (305 ft) high, including the 46-metre (151 ft) statue and its pedestal. The media picked up the apparent intention to cast the Orbit as London's answer to the Eiffel Tower, which is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall. The Guardian related how it was \"considerably shorter\",[11][18][32] also noting that it is even \"20 metres (66 ft) shorter than the diminutive Blackpool Tower\".[32] Its height was also compared in the media with other London landmarks. It was described as being \"slightly taller\" or \"nearly 20 metres (66 ft) taller\" than the Big Ben clock tower, the centrepiece of the Palace of Westminster.[11][18] It was also described as being \"twice as tall\" or \"more than double the height\" of Nelson's Column, the monument honouring Admiral Nelson in Trafalgar Square.[18] Other reports described how it was \"just short of\" or \"almost as tall as\" the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, the ancient tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu.[11][33] Big Ben is 96.3 metres (316 ft) tall, Nelson's Column is 51.5 metres (169 ft) tall, including statue and column. The Giza Pyramid was thought to have been constructed as 280 Egyptian cubits or 146.478 metres (480.57 ft) tall, although with erosion it has reduced in height by nearly 10 metres. Construction[edit] Construction in September 2011. Orbit is located in the southern area of the Olympic Park, between London Stadium and the Aquatics Centre.[10] After the March 2010 confirmation of the winning design,[5][18] construction began in November 2010; it reached its full height in November 2011.[34] Steel is the primary material used in the sculpture. According to Balmond, there was no feasible alternative, as steel was the only material that could give the minimum thickness and maximum strength represented in the coiling structure.[17] It was built from approximately 2000 tonnes of steel, produced as much as possible from ArcelorMittal plants, with the exact sourcing being determined by the grades of steel required and the technical requirements of the project.[5] Of this, 60% was recycled steel produced by the Esch Belval steel plant in Luxembourg.[35] On 14 March 2011, with construction already underway on the main pylon, The One Show broadcast footage of the on-site status of project, and profiled the four-man team putting it together, comprising two steel erectors, a crane operator and a site foreman. Use[edit] As an observation tower, Orbit has two indoor viewing platforms on two levels, with each level having capacity for 150 people.[18][31] According to the Greater London Authority, the observation platform offers \"unparalleled views of the entire 250 acres (1.0 km2; 0.39 sq mi) of the Olympic Park and London's skyline\".[10] According to The Independent, visitors should take the lift to the top and descend the 455-step staircase; this should allow them to appreciate the views around which Anish Kapoor arranged the sculpture.[31] It is designed to cope with 700 visitors per hour.[18] During the Olympic Games the entrance fee was £15 for adults and £7 for children.[31] The tower does not include a dining area, however there is a cafe, shop and other facilities at the South Park Hub building, which opened in April 2014. The ambition is that the sculpture, as well as being a focal point for the Olympic Park during the Games, will form part of the wider Stratford regeneration plans, which aim to turn the Olympic site into a permanent tourist destination after the Games.[4] Tessa Jowell said Orbit will be \"like to honey to bees for the millions of tourists that visit London each year\".[10] Boris Johnson predicted it would become \"the perfect iconic cultural legacy\".[10] According to Lord Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Olympic organisers, it would play a central part in the Game's role of leaving a lasting legacy and transformed landscape in east London.[10] During the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Joe Townsend (a Royal Marine and double amputee) delivered the Paralympic flame into Olympic Stadium via a zipline that was attached to the top of Orbit.[36] Orbit in 2016 with The Slide added.\nIn 2016, a permanent slide designed by German artist Carsten Höller was added to the sculpture. The slide is reported to be the world's tallest and longest tunnel slide at 178 metres.[37] Though it was originally reported that admission to the slide would cost around £5,[38] the general adult price for entry to the slide and viewing platforms is currently £16.50,[39] with additional rides costing £5 each. Funding[edit] At the time of its public launch, the total cost of Orbit was announced as £19.1m.[10] ArcelorMittal was to fund up to £16m, with the remaining £3.1m being provided by the London Development Agency.[10] This consists of a £10m cash donation, and £6 million in underwriting of capital costs, which could be potentially recovered from profits generated after the Games.[10] According to Johnson, the cost of the project would be recouped after the games through the private hire of a dining area at the top, predicting it would become a \"corporate money-making venture\".[18] Mittal said he was immediately interested in Orbit after he remembered the excitement that surrounded the announcement that London had won the Olympic bid. He saw it as an opportunity to leave a lasting legacy for London, showcase the \"unique qualities of steel\" and play a role in the regeneration of Stratford.[5] Mittal said of his involvement in the project, \"I live in London – I’ve lived here since 1997 – and I think it’s a wonderful city. This project is an incredible opportunity to build something really spectacular for London, for the Olympic Games and something that will play a lasting role in the legacy of the Games.\"[5] Advisory panel member and director of the Tate gallery, Nicholas Serota, said Orbit was \"the perfect answer to the question of how sport and art come together\", and praised Mittal's \"really impressive piece of patronage\" for supporting a \"great commission\".[21] In October 2015 Len Duvall, a Labour member of the London Assembly, stated that the tower was losing £520,000 a year; LLDC said they had revised their visitor target from 350,000 to 150,000 per year.[40] Reception[edit] Overall reception to Orbit was mixed, but mostly negative. With regard to its potential as a lasting visitor attraction, The Guardian's Mark Brown reflected on the mixed fortunes of other large symbolic London visitor attractions such as the popular, but loss-making, Thames Tunnel; the Skylon structure, dismantled on the orders of Winston Churchill; and the successful London Eye.[11] When plans were first reported for an Olympic tower, the media pointed to a manifesto pledge of Johnson's to crack down on tall buildings, in order to preserve London's \"precious\" skyline.[6][7] The Times criticised the idea as a vanity project of Johnson's, with a design \"matching his bravado\", built to \"seal his legacy\", surmising it would be compared to other similar vanity projects such as the \"wedding cake\", the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II built in Rome, or the Neutrality Arch, a rotating golden statue erected by Turkmenistan's President Saparmurat Niyazov, while comparing Johnson to Ozymandias.[6] Art critic Brian Sewell said \"Our country is littered with public art of absolutely no merit. We are entering a new period of fascist gigantism. These are monuments to egos and you couldn't find a more monumental ego than Boris.\"[6][7] The Times reported the description of it being the \"Godzilla of public art\".[12] In October 2012, ArcelorMittal Orbit was nominated and made the Building Design magazine shortlist for the Carbuncle Cup—an award for the worst British building completed in the past year, which was ultimately awarded to the Cutty Sark renovation.[41][42] Jay Merrick of The Independent said that \"[Orbit's] sculptural power lies in its ability to suggest an unfinished form in the process of becoming something else\", describing how its artistic riskiness elevated it above the banal artworks of the public art movement that have been built elsewhere in Britain's towns and cities. Merrick was of the opinion that it would be either loved or hated, being a design which is \"beautifully fractious, and not quite knowable\".[28] Jonathan Glancey of The Guardian described Orbit as \"Olympian in ambition\" and a \"fusion between striking art and daring engineering\", and said that, the Aquatics Centre apart, it represented the architecturally striking Joker in the pack, given that the rest of the landscaping and architecture for the Games \"promises little to get excited about\". He believed it would become a \"genuine eyecatcher\" for the Olympics television coverage, with its extraordinary form being a \"strange and enticing marriage of sorts\" between the Eiffel Tower and the un-built early Soviet era Tatlin's Tower, with the biblical Tower of Babel as \"best man\".[19] Richard Morrison of The Times described Orbit as \"like an enormous wire-mesh fence that has got hopelessly snagged round the bell of a giant french horn\", adding that it \"seems like an awful lot of trouble just to look at East London\", in comparison to a music hall comedian's refrain at the $16 million cost of the Brooklyn Bridge.[33] Morrison not only compared Johnson to Ozymandias, but also to the 20th century dictators Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Nicolae Ceaușescu, in their acts of \"phallic politics\" in building grandiose monuments.[33] Criticising the lack of public involvement, he described how it would be an \"undesired intrusion by the few into the consciousness of the many\".[33] He feared that it could become one of the many \"thousands of naff eyesores\" of recent public art in Britain, citing the embracing couple at St Pancras station (The Meeting Place), the Dockland's Traffic Light tree, and the proposed Rotherhithe Tunnel 'match-stick man' tribute to Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as London-based examples.[33] Fellow Times writer Tom Dyckhoff, while calling it \"a gift to the tabloids\" and a \"giant Mr. Messy\", questioned whether the Olympic site needed another pointless icon, postulating whether it would stand the test of time like the London Eye and become a true icon to match the Eiffel Tower, or a hopeless white elephant. Suggesting the project had echoes of Tatlin's Monument to the Third International, and especially Constant Nieuwenhuys' utopian city New Babylon, he asked whether Orbit was just as revolutionary or possessed the same ideological purpose, or whether it was merely \"a giant advert for one of the world’s biggest multinationals, sweetened with a bit of fun\".[27] Rowan Moore of The Guardian questioned if it was going to be anything more than a folly, or whether it would be as eloquent as the Statue of Liberty.[43] He speculated that the project might mark the time when society stops using large iconic projects as a tool for lifting areas out of deprivation. He questioned its ability to draw people's attention to Stratford after the Games, in a similar manner to the successes of the Angel of the North or the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.[43] He also questioned the piece's ability to strike a chord like the Angel, which he believed had at least \"created a feelgood factor and sense of pride\" in Gateshead, or whether it would simply become one of the \"many more unloved rotting wrecks that no one has the nerve to demolish\". He postulated that the addition of stairs and a lift made Orbit less succinct than Kapoor's previous successful works, while ultimately he said \"hard to see what the big idea is, beyond the idea of making something big\".[43] Fellow Guardian writer John Graham-Cumming rejected comparisons to icons like the Eiffel Tower, which had itself not been intended to be a lasting monument, only persisting into public acceptance as art through being useful; he also pointed out the Colossus of Rhodes collapsed within a few decades, and the Tower of Babel was \"constructed to glorify those that constructed it.\" He suggested that Johnson should reconsider whether it should be pulled down after 20 years. Questioning its corporate role, he believed that meant it looked less and less like a work of art and more like a vanity project.[32] In an online poll published by The Guardian, 38.6% of readers considered it a \"grand design\", while 61.4% for considered it \"garbage\".[44] Responding to concerns from The Times that ArcelorMittal's sponsorship and naming of Orbit would represent an improper incursion of corporate branding into public life, Johnson stated that Olympic rules mean that it cannot carry any corporate branding during the games.[8] Felicity Carus of The Guardian's environment blog questioned whether ArcelorMittal's record on carbon emissions was good enough to mean Orbit represented a fitting monument for the 2012 Olympics, billed as a 'world's first sustainable Olympics'.[45] Memorial controversy[edit] The Mittal Steel company purchased the Omarska mining complex and planned to resume extraction of iron ore from the site.[46] Mittal Steel announced in Banja Luka on 1 December 2005 that the company would build and finance a memorial in the 'White House' but the project was later abandoned. Many Bosnian Serbs believe there should not be a memorial, while many Bosniaks believe that construction should be postponed until all the victims are found and only if the entire mine—which is in use—be allocated for the memorial site.[47] By the time of the 20th anniversary of the camp's closure proposals for a physical memorial to the camp's existence had made no progress.  ArcelorMittal said that it was prepared to meet the former inmates' demands but the local authorities were ultimately responsible for granting permission. The Republika Srpska authorities considered that allowing camp survivors free access to the site and the construction of a memorial as originally agreed by ArcelorMittal would undermine reconciliation. \"Prijedor 92\" president Mirsad Duratović, stated that the campaign for a memorial would continue.[48] In July 2012, ahead of the start of the 2012 London Olympic Games, survivors of the camp laid claim to the ArcelorMittal Orbit tower, the tallest structure in Britain, located in the Olympic Park beside the Olympic stadium, as the 'Omarska Memorial in Exile'. The survivors allege that the Orbit is \"tragically intertwined with the history of war crimes in Bosnia, as the bones of victims are mixed in with the iron ore\". ArcelorMittal denied that material from Omarska had been used in the Orbit's construction. The company said that sensitive issues relating to the mine could not be addressed by ArcelorMittal on its own. Campaigners urged ArcelorMittal as the world's largest steel producer to use its considerable influence to oppose the local politics of denial and play an active role in healing fractured communities that have made the company's success possible. Susan Schuppli of the Centre for Research Architecture at Goldsmiths' College in London, observed that ArcelorMittal insistence on \"not taking sides\" in an area where persecution and injustice continued was not neutrality but taking a political position by default.[49] The Aquatics Centre (left), ArcelorMittal Orbit (centre), London Stadium (background, right) and Water Polo Arena (foreground, right) in the London Olympic Park viewed from the Westfield Stratford City in May 2012.\nAdvisory panel[edit] The advisory panel consisted of:[10] Nicholas Serota , director of the Tate gallery.\nJulia Peyton-Jones , director of the Serpentine Gallery.\nHans-Ulrich Obrist , also of the Serpentine Gallery.\nSarah Weir OBE, of the Olympic Delivery Authority.\nStuart Lipton, of Chelsfield LLP.\nAnita Zabludowicz , of the 176 gallery Zabludowicz collection.\nMichael Morris and James Lingwood , directors of the Artangel arts commissioning organisation.\nMunira Mirza, the Mayoral Advisor on Arts and Culture.\nIn announcing the winning design, Johnson thanked the Greater London Authority, the Olympic Delivery Authority and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, as well as David McAlpine and Philip Dilley of Arup, and Sir Robin Wales and Jules Pipe for their involvement and support in the project.[4] See also[edit] Visual Arts portal London portal Olympics portal.\nB of the Bang , the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games sculpture.\nSkylon , the London 1951 Festival of Britain tower.\nThe White Horse at Ebbsfleet , a proposed giant sculpture for Kent.\nGoogie architecture , earlier space-inspired architecture.\nUnisphere , constructed by competitor United States Steel for the 1964 New York World's Fair.\nFootnotes[edit] ^ ArcelorMittal Orbit Perspectives Archived 22 June 2012 at the Wayback Machine , retrieved 15 June 2012.\n^ a b.\nChozick, Amy (1 June 2012). \"A Lightning Rod Masquerading as a Sculpture\" .

{"id": 259, "data": "Anish Kapoor  Anish Kapoor is one of the most influential sculptors of his generation. Perhaps most famous for public sculptures that are both adventures in form and feats of engineering, Kapoor manoeuvres between vastly different scales, across numerous series of work. Immense PVC skins, stretched or deflated; concave or convex mirrors whose reflections attract and swallow the viewer; recesses carved in stone and pigmented so as to disappear: these voids and protrusions summon up deep-felt metaphysical polarities of presence and absence, concealment and revelation. Forms turn themselves inside out, womb-like, and materials are not painted but impregnated with colour, as if to negate the idea of an outer surface, inviting the viewer to the inner reaches of the imagination. Kapoor’s geometric forms from the early 1980s, for example, rise up from the floor and appear to be made of pure pigment, while the viscous, blood-red wax sculptures from the last ten years – kinetic and self-generating – ravage their own surfaces and explode the quiet of the gallery environment. There are resonances with mythologies of the ancient world – Indian, Egyptian, Greek and Roman – and with modern times.  Anish Kapoor was born in Mumbai, India in 1954 and lives and works in London. He studied at Hornsey College of Art, London, UK (1973–77) followed by postgraduate studies at Chelsea School of Art, London, UK (1977–78). Recent solo exhibitions include Modern Art Oxford, UK (2021); Museum of Contemporary Art and Urban Planning, Shenzhen, China (2021); Houghton Hall, Norfolk, UK (2020); Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, Germany (2020); ‘Surge’ at Fundación Proa, Buenos Aires, Argentina (2019); Central Academy of Fine Arts Museum and Imperial Ancestral Temple, Beijing, China (2019); CorpArtes, Santiago, Chile (2019); Pitzhanger Manor and Gallery, London, UK (2019); Serralves Museum, Porto, Portugal (2018); ‘Descension’’ at Public Art Fund, Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 1, New York, NY, USA (2017); Parque de la Memoria, Buenos Aires, Argentina (2017); MAST Foundation, Bologna, Italy (2017); Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC), Mexico City, Mexico (2016); Couvent de la Tourette, Eveux, France (2015); Château de Versailles, Versailles, France (2015) and The Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center, Moscow, Russia (2015). He represented Britain at the 44th Venice Biennale in 1990 with Void Field (1989), for which he was awarded the Premio Duemila for Best Young Artist. Kapoor won the Turner Prize in 1991 and has honorary fellowships from the University of Wolverhampton, UK (1999), the Royal Institute of British Architecture, London, UK (2001) and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford, UK (2014). Anish Kapoor was awarded a CBE in 2003 and a Knighthood in 2013 for services to visual arts. Large scale public projects include Cloud Gate (2004) in Millennium Park, Chicago, USA and Orbit (2012) in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, UK and Ark Nova (2013) the world's first inflatable concert hall in Japan.

Photo Ela Bialkowska Mastering material, space and colour Born in Mumbai in 1954, Anish Kapoor lives and works in London.\nHe’s one of the most well-known contemporary sculptors. His mastery of diverse materials as well as the presence of his works in public spaces are what have embedded his status and recognizability in art and popular culture.\nThe materials favoured by Anish Kapoor are differing and sometimes unusual; cement, rusted steel, fiberglass, PVC, granite, alabaster, stainless steel, marble, wax and pigments.\nThe man made or natural materials are manipulated, their stationary and dynamic qualities are worked with in order to create a form that becomes a medium with which the artist communicates. Colour and material are the other fundamental elements to Kapoor’s work; they become the vessels through which he communicates.\nColour is an essential element of his oeuvre and is fundamental for the viewer’s perception of form. The form, in turn, expresses the nature of the material.\nSpecific dualities are present in his work and vary from purity and chaos, density and void, to smooth and rough. These are all dualities that are at times present simultaneously and that can be adopted by different components of the work.\nKapoor’s exercises in colour focused on the primary colours blue, red and yellow. The artist has moved on to experiment with other tones throughout his career.\nRed has been one of the most prominent and frequently explored by Kapoor; its deep, visceral and associative qualities being particularly significant both for the artist and for the general perception of the public. Colour in his works is always conceived not as an example of what it is, but as the colour itself embodied.\nAnother preoccupation of the artist is space, many of his works lie on the threshold between subject and object as well as space only as a notion, implying there is something, the void, beyond it.\nThe auto-generated is also important for Kapoor as he is interested in an artwork’s independence from the artist as it surrenders itself, often through mechanically dynamic means, and becomes a force and a catalyst for developments within the work.\nAmongst his most recent solo shows we mention: Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA) Museum & Taimiao Art Museum of Imperial Ancestral Temple, Beijing (2019), Fundácion CorpArtes, Santiago, Chile (2019), Pitzhanger Manor, London (2019), Serralves, Museu de Arte Contemorânea, Porto (2018); Parque de la Memoria, Buenos Aires (2017); Museo d'Arte Contemporanea di Roma (MACRO), Rome (2016); Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC), Mexico City (2016).

He was also the first living artist to be given a solo show at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Kapoor was born in India to parents of Punjabi and Iraqi-Jewish heritage. He moved to London to study at the Hornsey College of Art (1973–77) and the Chelsea School of Art (1977–78). A return visit to India in 1979 sparked new perspectives on the land of his birth. These were reflected through his use of saturated pigments and striking architectural forms in bodies of work such as 1000 Names. Created between 1979 and 1980, this series consisted of arrangements of abstract geometric forms coated with loose powdered pigments that spilled beyond the object itself and onto the floor or wall. During the 1980s and ’90s Kapoor was increasingly recognized for his biomorphic sculptures and installations, made with materials as varied as stone, aluminum, and resin, that appeared to challenge gravity, depth, and perception. In 1990 he represented Great Britain at the Venice Biennale with his installation Void Field, a grid of rough sandstone blocks, each with a mysterious black hole penetrating its top surface. The following year he was honoured with the Turner Prize, a prestigious award for contemporary art. Kapoor continued to explore the idea of the void during the remainder of the decade, creating series of works that incorporated constructions that receded into walls, disappeared into floors, or dramatically changed depth with a simple change in perspective. In the early 21st century Kapoor’s interest in addressing site and architecture led him to create projects that were increasingly ambitious in scale and construction. For his 2002 installation Marsyas at the Tate Modern gallery in London, Kapoor created a trumpetlike form by erecting three massive steel rings joined by a 550-foot (155-metre) span of fleshy red plastic membrane that stretched the length of the museum’s Turbine Hall. In 2004 Kapoor unveiled Cloud Gate in Chicago’s Millennium Park; the 110-ton elliptical archway of highly polished stainless steel—nicknamed “The Bean”—was his first permanent site-specific installation in the United States. For just over a month in 2006, Kapoor’s Sky Mirror, a concave stainless-steel mirror 35 feet (11 metres) in diameter, was installed in New York City’s Rockefeller Center. Both Cloud Gate and Sky Mirror reflected and transformed their surroundings and demonstrated Kapoor’s ongoing investigation of material, form, and space.

The structure, commissioned by the city of London for the 2012 Olympic Games, stood in London’s Olympic Park, and an observation deck at the top of the tower opened to the public in conjunction with the sporting event. Kapoor exhibited his work throughout the world, including on the grounds of Versailles (2015), France—where the colossal sculpture Dirty Corner (2011) was vandalized several times. Descension (2014), a swirling vortex of water, was shown at Brooklyn Bridge Park (2017), New York City, among various locations, while Sky Mirror (2018) and other pieces were presented at Houghton Hall (2020), Norfolk, England. Kapoor was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2003, and he was named a knight bachelor in 2013. He received the Japan Art Association’s Praemium Imperiale prize for sculpture in 2011.\n Michal Raz-Russo The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica \n", "label": [[98, 110, "ARTIST"], [112, 122, "WORK_OF_ART"], [144, 158, "DATE"], [168, 180, "GPE"], [221, 225, "DATE"], [241, 245, "DATE"], [275, 287, "ARTIST"], [296, 310, "DATE"], [312, 318, "GPE"], [324, 330, "GPE"], [333, 338, "GPE"], [566, 572, "GPE"], [574, 580, "ARTIST"], [660, 666, "GPE"], [707, 714, "DATE"], [747, 754, "DATE"], [775, 780, "GPE"], [784, 788, "DATE"], [986, 999, "DATE"], [1180, 1185, "DATE"], [1190, 1194, "DATE"], [1195, 1201, "ARTIST"], [1402, 1406, "DATE"], [1422, 1435, "GPE"], [1443, 1458, "EVENT"], [1481, 1491, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1690, 1696, "ARTIST"], [1962, 1974, "DATE"], [1975, 1981, "ARTIST"], [2124, 2128, "DATE"], [2142, 2149, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2157, 2168, "GALLERY"], [2180, 2186, "GPE"], [2188, 2194, "ARTIST"], [2371, 2383, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2388, 2392, "DATE"], [2393, 2399, "ARTIST"], [2409, 2419, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2423, 2431, "GPE"], [2527, 2535, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2591, 2608, "GPE"], [2635, 2639, "DATE"], [2641, 2647, "ARTIST"], [2650, 2660, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2745, 2758, "GPE"], [2786, 2796, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2801, 2811, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2874, 2880, "ARTIST"], [2935, 2945, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2946, 2956, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3008, 3020, "ARTIST"], [3022, 3026, "DATE"], [3048, 3055, "GPE"], [3072, 3078, "ARTIST"], [3101, 3120, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3132, 3136, "DATE"], [3265, 3271, "GPE"], [3280, 3284, "DATE"], [3309, 3315, "GPE"], [3441, 3447, "ARTIST"], [3529, 3533, "DATE"], [3536, 3542, "GPE"], [3586, 3590, "DATE"], [3622, 3632, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3634, 3638, "DATE"], [3704, 3708, "DATE"], [3711, 3724, "GPE"], [3757, 3767, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3769, 3773, "DATE"], [3825, 3829, "DATE"], [3832, 3848, "GPE"], [3850, 3856, "ARTIST"], [3920, 3924, "DATE"], [3964, 3968, "DATE"], [4052, 4056, "DATE"]]}

I accept the cookie & privacy policy .\n Born in 1954 in Bombay (now Mumbai), Anish Kapoor moved to London in the early 1970s. He received a BA in fine art at Hornsey College of Art and an MA in fine art at the Chelsea School of Art and Design. Kapoor studied under Paul Neagu, a Romanian-born artist who was instrumental in helping Kapoor articulate a cross-cultural artistic vision that would be a lasting foundation for his career.\nKapoor first came to wider attention in the group exhibition New Sculpture (1978) at the Hayward Gallery, London. The show featured several artists who were a part of the New British Sculpture movement, which broke from the Minimalism and Post-Minimalism of previous generations and instead infused art with postmodern viewpoints that include merging high and low art forms, using new technologies in unconventional ways, and greater recognition of cultural diversity.\nA sculptural innovator, Kapoor is particularly known for his unexpected use of terrene materials such as limestone, granite, dirt, concrete, and colorful pigment, along with his ability to create engaging environments that inspire a meditative, poetic experience. Kapoor fashions largely monochromatic and deceptively simple works that challenge ideas of rationality and perception through the interplay of curvilinear forms, reflective surfaces, and size. His works are grounded in Eastern metaphysics and often serve as evocative statements of perception, spirituality, the body, the mind, as well as yin-and-yang dualities inherent in nature.\nIn the mid-1990s his works became more ambitious in scale, and he began exploring industrial materials such as PVC, fiberglass, and steel. In creating larger, monumental works, Kapoor began to integrate his sculpture and installations more fully within the surrounding environment. Shown at the Tate Modern, London, Marsyas (2002), a sinuous, hollowed-out, blood-red stretched membrane that has three tuba-like openings, spanned the entire length of the 3,400-square-foot Turbine Hall, and Dirty Corner (2011), a nearly 200-foot tubular steel structure installed at the Fabbrica del Vapore, Milan, also dominates and envelops its venue.\nKapoor has completed several commissioned public installations, such as his first permanent site-specific installation in the United States, Cloud Gate (2004), which is commonly known as the “Bean,” in Chicago. Among other public works, he created Sky Mirror (2006) in New York, Cinema di Terra (2009) in the Parco Nazionale del Pollino in southern Italy, and Leviathan (2011) at the Grand Palais in Paris. He has received numerous international awards and honors, including the Premio Duemila, Venice Biennale (representing Britain, 1990); Turner Prize, Tate Gallery, London (1991); and Praemium Imperiale, Japan Art Association (2011).\nIn 2003 he was given the title of Commander of the British Empire and in 2011 Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Commissioned by and presented at the Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin, Memory (2008–09), a 24-ton Cor-Ten steel tank traveled to the Guggenheim Museum in 2009. Kapoor has also had solo exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2008); Royal Academy of Arts, London (2009); National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi (2010); Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2010); and the École national supérieure des beaux-arts de Paris (2011).

{"id": 265, "data": "Please check our safety measures and our ticketing policy. Anish Kapoor 1954, Mumbay, India.\nShare Anish Kapoor was born on March 12, 1954, in Mumbay, India. He moved to England when he was 19-years-old to attend the Hornsey College of Art in London (1973–77) followed by the Chelsea School of Art (1977–78). Upon concluding his studies, he taught at Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1979. The following year, Kapoor was given his first solo show in Paris, held at the studio of Patrice Alexandre. This marked the beginning of his intense exhibition activity. In the early 80’s his sculptural oeuvre revolved around the multiplicity of new forms, forms in a continuous dialogue between two- and three-dimensionality. This would make him one of the most exemplary members of New British Sculpture, a term applied to the new sculpture scene in England, including artists such as Tony Cragg and Antony Gormley. Throughout the 80’s, in a continuous investigation of the dialectic of opposites, the artist executed sculptures that were partially abstract and completely coated in pure pigment. But in the 90’s, his works assumed dimensions of an increasingly more monumental scale, often centered on the idea of the empty. The empty, however, is rendered tangible vis-à-vis a cavity that is filled or by material that is hollowed out. After participating in the 44th Venice Biennale in 1990 where he won the Premio Duemila, and upon winning the Turner Prize in 1991, Kapoor became internationally famous. He began exhibiting world-wide and to concentrate on private and public commissions. In 2004, Kapoor unveiled Cloud Gate, a commissioned work for Chicago’s Millennium Park. It is an enormous elliptical arc made of reflective stainless steel. Kapoor is said to have derived his inspiration for the piece from liquid mercury. Significant exhibitions of his work have been held at the Fondazione Prada in Milan (1995), the Hayward Gallery in London (1998), the Piazza del Plebiscito in Naples (1999), the National Archaeology Museum in Naples (2003), Shiraishi Contemporary Art in Tokyo (2005), and the Gladstone Gallery on New York (2007).

World renowned for his perception-defying sculptures and large-scale public installations, Kapoor works with industrial materials like mirror, steel, stone, and vinyl to create forms that evoke the metaphysical and challenge viewers’ ideas about physical space. Kapoor’s sublime use of concave forms, reflective surfaces, intense colors, and monumental scale invites viewers to experience both collective awe and private contemplation. Kapoor moved from India to London in the early 1970s to study art. His early works utilized vibrant powdered pigment, sculpted into perfect geometric forms. In the mid-1990s, Kapoor began working with materials like fiberglass, stainless steel, and PVC. Hallmarks of his practice are monochromatic palettes —intense hues of black, red, and blue—with which Kapoor creates mysterious negative spaces, or voids, within his sculptures. He is best known for his enigmatic large-scale works and public installations, such as the famous Cloud Gate, fondly referred to as “The Bean,” in Chicago’s Millennium Park. Cloud Gate, like many of Kapoor’s works, utilizes reflective surfaces and captivates viewers with its awe-inspiring scale and deceptive beauty. More recently, Kapoor has created works made of blood-red wax and mechanical systems that catapult the material across galleries’ floors and walls. Inviting closer examination, these provocative feats of engineering push viewers to contemplate intersections of concepts: the biomorphic and geometric, the form and the void, the human body and the spirit. Kapoor received a BA in fine art at Hornsey College of Art and an MA in fine art at the Chelsea School of Art and Design. Kapoor was awarded Knighthood (2013) and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (2003). He was elected as a Royal Academician (1999) and received the Turner Prize (1991), among other honors.

He lives in London, where he moved in the early 1970s to attend art school. For more than 35 years, Kapoor has been among the most inventive and influential artists of his generation. He has created compelling and poetic bodies of work using a range of materials that include raw pigment, stone, stainless steel, synthetic polymer, resin, and wax. He also has a longstanding interest in the sculptural potential of water. Descension, presented for the first time in the United States, represents a breakthrough with this inherently challenging, slippery substance. Like all of Kapoor’s works, Descension is the result of intensive research into material and process, exploring the potential of water to behave in surprising ways. The continuous swirling motion of this 26-foot-diameter liquid mass converges in a central vortex, as if rushing water is being sucked into the earth’s depths. We thus experience Kapoor’s abstract form on multiple levels. Its powerful physicality has a visceral and mesmerizing impact. Yet Descension also stimulates the imagination and suggests a social, cultural, and even mythic dimension. Descension‘s operating hours are 9:00am – 9:00pm\nDescension will not be operational on Tuesday, August 15, for routine maintenance. This exhibition is curated by Public Art Fund Director and Chief Curator Nicholas Baume.\n Location Location Brooklyn Bridge Park, Pier 1.\nGet Directions.\nPhoto Gallery About the Artist Anish Kapoor is one of the most influential sculptors working today.

{"id": 269, "data": "Skip to content By Mark Westall • 12 November 2021\nShare — Anish Kapoor will be the first British artist to be honoured with a major exhibition at the Gallerie dell’Accademia in Venice during the Venice Biennale next year opening on 20th April 2022 and running until 9th October 2022. Anish Kapoor Portrait by George Darrell, 2021 The exhibition will have retrospective elements alongside newer bodies of work, presenting key moments in the artist’s career. Ground-breaking new works, created using carbon nanotechnology, will be shown for the first time, as well as recent paintings and sculpture that are testament to the vitality and visionary nature of Kapoor’s current practice. “It’s a huge honour to be invited to engage with the collections at the Gallerie dell’ Accademia in Venice, perhaps one of the finest collections of classical painting anywhere in the world. All art must engage with what went before. The Accademia presents a wonderful and wondrous challenge. I feel a deep commitment to Venice, its architecture and its support for the contemporary arts.”Anish Kapoor Taco Dibbits, Anish Kapoor,  Giulio Manieri Elia, Photo: Luca Zanon Tiepolo-Castigo-dei-serpenti As announced today, 12th November 2021, during a press conference held at the museum in the presence of the Director Giulio Manieri Elia, the curator of the exhibition, Taco Dibbits and Anish Kapoor, in addition to the main show at the Gallerie dell’ Accademia, a group of important works will also be presented at the historic Palazzo Manfrin, where some of the most famous works in the Gallerie dell’ Accademia’s collection originally hung. Palazzo Manfrin was purchased in 1788 by Count Girolamo Manfrin, a wealthy tobacco merchant who transformed the first floor of the building into a picture gallery which quickly became one of Venice’s major tourist attractions visited by among others Antonio Canova, Lord Byron, John Ruskin and Edouard Manet. Palazzo Manfrin Photo: Luca Zanon When, around the middle of the nineteenth century, works in the collection were sold, after the death of Manfrin, the heritage of the Gallerie dell’Accademia was enriched with twenty-one paintings including masterpieces such as Giorgione’s The Tempest and La Vecchia and works by Mantegna, Memling, Nicolò di Pietro, Girolamo Savoldo and Moretto. Gallerie Accademia Photo: Luca Zanon “All artists, however cutting-edge and contemporary, are in debate with those who have gone before. The Gallerie dell’Accademia is the perfect site for a modern master to explore the themes that have always engaged sculptors and painters. Kapoor’s latest works, using the most advanced nanotechnology, promise to be a revelation.”Taco Dibbits Gallerie dell’Accademia Campo  della  Carità, Dorsoduro 1050, Venezia www.gallerieaccademia.it\nPalazzo Manfrin Fondamenta Venier, Cannaregio, 342, 30121 Venezia About the artist Anish Kapoor is considered to be one of the most influential artists working today.

{"id": 270, "data": "Anish Kapoor Born in 1954 in Bombay (India), ANISH KAPOOR lives and works in London (England). The artist of Indian origin began his career with fragile sculptures and installations made of colored pigments. Beginning in the end of the 1980s, he came to a turning point in his practice, rethinking – and inversing – the inside and outside of sculpture. Regularly returning to stonework, Anish Kapoor reflects on the concepts of negative and positive. And while he sculpts material, from polished steel to resin to pigments and fiberglass, he also works on color itself. Kamel Mennour and Anish Kapoor have been working together since 2011. Anish Kapoor’s work quickly earned international recognition and has been awarded many prizes, such as the distinguished Turner Prize, which he won in 1991. His body of work has since been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions in the world’s most prestigious museums, including the Guggenheim in New York, the Louvre and the Grand Palais in Paris, the Royal Academy and the Tate Modern in London, the Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland, the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid, the National Gallery in Ottawa, the CAPC in Bordeaux, the Chateau de Versailles and the Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Roma (MACRO) in Rome.

He had his first solo show at Patrice Alexander, Paris in 1980, and his first solo exhibition in a public gallery in 1982 following his term as Artist in Residence at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. It was also in 1982 that he had the first of his many solo exhibitions at the Lisson Gallery, London. His first solo show in New York was at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery in 1984. Kapoor represented Britain at the XLIV Venice Biennale in 1990 when he was awarded the Premio Duemila Prize, and in 1991 he received the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery, London. He has participated in many important solo and group exhibitions throughout the world and has undertaken a number of major large-scale installations and commissions including: Tarantantara for the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, Parabolic Waters for the Millennium Dome New Sculpture Project, London, both in 2000, and Marsyasfor the Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London in 2002. During the last decade Kapoor has received a number of honorary doctorates and fellowships from academic institutions, and in 2003 he was appointed CBE. He lives and works in London. Kapoor’s first use of powdered pigment for his sculpture followed a visit to his native India in 1979. The earliest of these sculptures were composed of pigment and chalk and comprised of groupings of forms in pure colour: \"one of the things I was trying to do was to arrive at something which was as if unmade, as if self-manifest, as if there by its own volition.\" As he developed his sculpture, a basic support of wood, fibreglass or plaster was introduced and the shapes began to suggest plant and mineral forms as in White Sand, Red Millet, Many Flowers, 1982 and The Chant of Blue, 1983. It was these works which secured his early reputation both at home and on the international stage as his sculpture was selected for showing in important exhibitions such as Aperto '82, XL Venice Biennale in 1982, and Transformations: new Sculpture from Britainat the XVII São Paulo Bienal, in 1983. In addition to the exterior colour, he began to explore the interior spaces of objects with the 'void' sculptures from the mid 1980s onwards: \"to make an object which is not an object, to make a hole in the space, to make something which actually does not exist.\" Over the years he has worked with a wide variety of materials including sandstone, marble, concrete, iron and steel. Colour has always been an essential symbolic ingredient in his work and has continued to inform and provide a driving force for Kapoor as most powerfully expressed in the monumental void works of recent years.

Courtesy of Adam Berry/Getty Images By Shira Wolfe “That’s what I am interested in: the void, the moment when it isn’t a hole. It is a space full of what isn’t there.” Anish Kapoor Share Tweet Share 0 Shares.\nWho is Anish Kapoor? Boundary-breaking sculptors are those, who in his or her own way pushed the medium of sculpture forwards into new, unique territories. Anish Kapoor is a leading contemporary artist best known for his large-scale public abstract sculptural works like Cloud Gate (2006), a monumental public installation known locally as “The Bean”, in Chicago’s Millennium Park. Working in a variety of materials including mirrors, stone, wax and PVC, Kapoor is interested in exploring biomorphic and geometric forms, with a particular focus on negative space, the void. Kapoor frequently plays with holes, reflection, perspective and gravity-challenging structures. Anish Kapoor pigment piece installation view, 2009. Courtesy The Royal Academy of Arts, London, UK Biography of Anish Kapoor Anish Kapoor – Objects About Doing and Ritual Born in 1954 in Mumbai, India, the son of an Iraqi-Jewish mother and a father who was a hydrographer in the navy, Kapoor moved to Israel when he was 17, mostly because the plane ticket was to paid for him. Whilst living there in a Kibbutz, the notion of being an artist first occurred to him, an ambition he felt strongly he could do something actively about. He moved to London to pursue this dream, where he studied at Hornsey College of Art and Chelsea School of Art. During his time at art school, he created a lot of performance-based pieces that were deeply symbolic and most usually involved interaction between two people. The pieces were non-narrative, but process-based. An epiphany came in 1979, two years after Kapoor graduated from art school. While visiting his native India, Kapoor was hit by the realisation that the art he had been making had a relationship to what he saw in India. It had to do with a certain attitude towards the object. Kapoor was making objects that were about doing, about ritual. And this aspect of doing, of ritual, he saw everywhere around him in India. As though he had received a kind of affirmation, Kapoor continued to follow his impulses regarding the representation of ritual in his art and from this his first significant works emerged, known as his pigment pieces, consisting of bright shapes on the ground covered in pure pigment. Anish Kapoor, Marsyas, 2003. Courtesy Tate Modern, London, UK Scale as a Tool of Sculpture One of Kapoor’s most famous sculptures is Marsyas, the 10-story-high, 150-metres-long trumpet-shaped structure that occupied Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in 2002. In Kapoor’s words, “Every idea has its scale. Marsyas wouldn’t be what it is if it were a third of the scale. The pyramids are the size they are because they are. Scale is a tool, a tool of sculpture.” When creating Marsyas, the most important idea for Kapoor was that the viewer could never have a complete view of the sculpture. As such, it would remain mysterious, somehow incomprehensible and unfathomable, and therefore, crucially unobtainable. Visitors experienced the sculpture in a series of different encounters, each time taking in a part of the whole. Another famous Kapoor sculpture is Cloud Gate (2006) in Chicago, nicknamed “The Bean” due to its kidney bean form. This shiny stainless steel sculpture, reflecting and distorting its surroundings whilst also vast enough to allow people to walk underneath its arch, measures 10 by 20 by 13 metres. Kapoor notes the importance of perception and context in its shifting scale: close to the object, it seems very large, while moving away enables a perspective to include the Chicago skyscrapers which tower high above it.

He began exploring the theme of the void in large-scale stone works, at times defining the insides and outsides, at other times clearly delineating empty spaces. He describes the void as being a state within, a potential space, not a non-space. With his exploration of the void, Kapoor approaches psychology, fear, death, and love in as direct a way as possible, yet avoiding direct storytelling or meaning. Significantly, Kapoor asserts that he has nothing to say as an artist, no message for the world. As such, he explains, meaning arises because it must, not because he puts it there.

Photo by Paola Martinez Fiterre, courtesy Galeria Continua Anish Kapoor on a Smaller Scale Although he is famed for his impressive large-scale works, Kapoor also continues to create smaller scale works, making pieces that fit in the context of the gallery space. Just as is the case with Kapoor’s larger public works, these smaller works invite viewers to interrogate their relation to space. With their often sumptuously saturated colours, potential to evoke physical and emotional depth, and invocation of the profundity of the sublime, Kapoor confronts the viewer’s expectation of optical perception, pushing for a re-examination of phenomenological experience – whether through a seemingly infinite black hole, an impossible reflection or mysterious, semi-reflective hues.

Courtesy Lisson Gallery Anish Kapoor and Vantablack One of Kapoor’s more recent fascinating undertakings is his work with Vantablack, the blackest synthetic material in the world that absorbs 99.96 % of light. Developed by British researchers for aerospace, engineering, optics, and military and defence, Kapoor heard about their development and eagerly reached out to Surrey NanoSystems, the company manufacturing Vantablack, to collaborate. Kapoor bought an exclusive license to use the material, making it impossible for other artists to experiment with this blackest black, and causing quite the uproar in the art world. Among the most incensed was Stuart Semple, who, out of spite, developed the production of the “world’s pinkest pink” and glitteriest glitter. Kapoor is set to unveil his first works using Vantablack at the 2021 Venice Biennale. Kapoor once said, “I don’t want to do what I did before, I want to do what I just don’t know how to do.” His exploration with the complex Vantablack material might be the very peak of this approach to life and art.

Kapoor’s work is part of notable collections worldwide, from the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Tate Modern in London, and Fondazione Prada in Milan to the Guggenheim in Bilbao, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa, Japan.

Born in Bombay, Kapoor has lived and worked in London since the early 1970s when he moved to study art, first at the Hornsey College of Art and later at the Chelsea School of Art and Design. He represented Britain in the XLIV Venice Biennale in 1990, when he was awarded the Premio Duemila Prize. In 1991, he received the Turner Prize and in 2002 received the Unilever Commission for the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern. Notable public sculptures include Cloud Gate (colloquially known as \"the Bean\") in Chicago's Millennium Park; Sky Mirror, exhibited at the Rockefeller Center in New York City in 2006 and Kensington Gardens in London in 2010; Temenos, at Middlehaven, Middlesbrough; Leviathan, at the Grand Palais in Paris in 2011; and ArcelorMittal Orbit, commissioned as a permanent artwork for London's Olympic Park and completed in 2012. In 2017 Kapoor designed the statuette for the 2018 Brit Awards. Kapoor received a knighthood in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to visual arts. He was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Oxford in 2014. In 2012, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Indian government which is India's third-highest civilian award. An image of Kapoor features in the British cultural icons section of the newly designed British passport in 2015. In 2016, he was announced as a recipient of the LennonOno Grant for Peace. In February 2017 Kapoor, who describes himself as Jewish, was announced as the recipient of the USD$1 million Genesis Prize, which \"recognises individuals who have attained excellence and international renown in their fields and whose actions and achievements express a commitment to Jewish values, the Jewish community and the State of Israel”. Anish Kapoor was born in Bombay, India (now Mumbai), to a Hindu father and a Jewish mother whose family immigrated from Baghdad when she was a few months old. According to Kapoor, his mother had an Indian-Jewish upbringing, her father being the cantor of the synagogue in Pune. At this time, Baghdadi Jews constituted the majority of the Jewish community in Mumbai. His father, from a Hindu Punjabi family, was a hydrographer and applied physicist in the Indian Navy. Kapoor is the brother of Canada-based academic Ilan Kapoor. Kapoor attended The Doon School, an all-boys boarding school in Dehradun, then in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. He is said to have \"hated\" his time at Doon. In 1971–1973, he travelled to Israel with one of his two brothers, initially living on a kibbutz. He began to study electrical engineering, but had trouble with mathematics and quit after six months. In Israel, he decided to become an artist. In 1973, he left for Britain to attend Hornsey College of Art and Chelsea School of Art and Design. There he found a role model in Paul Neagu, an artist who provided a meaning to what he was doing. Kapoor went on to teach at Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1979 and in 1982 was Artist in Residence at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. He has lived and worked in London since the early 1970s.

{"id": 277, "data": "Artists / Makers / Authors > Anish Kapoor.\nAnish Kapoor Learn about ANISH KAPOOR (B. 1954) artist,their past and upcoming works offered at auction at Christie's The towering achievement of Indian-born British artist Anish Kapoor stands alone in contemporary British art. The greatest British sculptor since Henry Moore, his monumental, biomorphic, mirrored works grace major cities the world over and have made him a household name. Extraordinary pieces of public sculpture, luminous with reflected light, they distort ideas of space and play with the line between art and architecture, exerting a curious, totemic power over their often-genteel settings. ‘If Duchamp declared that all objects in the world are art,’ Kapoor has said, referring to the French Surrealist’s famous 1917 submission of a urinal for a New York exhibition, ‘then I am interested in the next stage of that argument…. that all objects in the world are symbolic.’ Born in Bombay to an Iraqi-Jewish mother and a Hindu father, Kapoor has always drawn on the spiritual and mythological heritage of his upbringing. After a spell in Israel, he moved to London in 1973 and studied at Hornsey College of Art and Chelsea School of Art. His early works, such as As if to Celebrate, I Discovered a Mountain Blooming with Red Flowers (1981), were geometric shapes of raw colour evocative of the vivid kumkuma powder of Hindu ritual. In 1982 he represented Britain at the Paris Biennale and, from the late Eighties, moving away from colour, he began producing works such as The Earth (1992) and the mausoleum-like Descent into Limbo (1992) – his first haunting explorations into distortions and the symbolic potential of space. In 1991, having represented Britain at the 1990 Venice Biennale, he won the Turner Prize. Over the next two decades, Kapoor would establish himself as one of the most important sculptors of his generation. In 2003 he was awarded a CBE and, a year later, earned his first public commission in the United States, the now-iconic Cloud Gate (2004-6) in Chicago. Other monumental public works followed, including Leviathan (2011) in Paris’s Grand Palais, and the iconic ArcelorMittal Orbit tower for London’s 2012 Olympic Games. In 2009, Kapoor was the first living artist in Royal Academy history to be given the entirety of the gallery for a solo show.\n Upcoming lots by this artist No upcoming lots were found for Anish Kapoor .\n Related Features 6 April 2022 | Article.\n‘I told you I’m a mad fool!’ — Anish Kapoor’s Venetian palace.\n9 December 2019 | Article.\n‘I want the artist to be triggered by the landscape’.\n24 July 2019 | Article.\nWhat I’ve learned: Mira Lapidot, chief curator of fine arts at the Israel Museum.\n23 October 2015 | Article.\n5 trends from FIAC — and why Paris is still important.\n6 January 2015 | Article.\nAntenna: ‘Honey, I shrunk the sculpture’.\n23 May 2012 | Video.\nHouse of Cards: An Exhibition of Contemporary Sculpture in Response to Chardin – Christie’s at the Rothschild Collection at Waddesdon Manor.\nBrowse more features.\nRelated Departments Post-War & Contemporary Art.\nPast Results for Artist LOT \n8\n                                                                                          , SALE 7602 Anish Kapoor (b. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED GBP 1,071,650.\nLOT \n19\n                                                                                          , SALE 10337 Anish Kapoor (B. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED GBP 1,202,500.\nLOT \n39\n                                                                                          , SALE 15485 Anish Kapoor (B. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED GBP 1,028,750.\nLOT \n39\n                                                                                          , SALE 10863 ANISH KAPOOR (B. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED GBP 818,500.\nLOT \n18\n                                                                                          , SALE 1106 Anish Kapoor (b. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED GBP 825,250.\nLOT \n32\n                                                                                          , SALE 7565 Anish Kapoor (b. 1954) Blood Cinema PRICE REALIZED GBP 636,500.\nLOT \n12\n                                                                                          , SALE 5709 Anish Kapoor (b. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED GBP 713,250.\nLOT \n60\n                                                                                          , SALE 1134 Anish Kapoor (b. 1954) Pool PRICE REALIZED GBP 721,875.\nLOT \n455\n                                                                                          , SALE 2787 Anish Kapoor (b. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED USD 1,113,750.\nLOT \n41\n                                                                                          , SALE 14442 Anish Kapoor (b. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED GBP 848,750.\nLOT \n32\n                                                                                          , SALE 10337 Anish Kapoor (B. 1954) Mother as a Ship PRICE REALIZED GBP 722,500.\nLOT \n60\n                                                                                          , SALE 15473 Anish Kapoor (b. 1954) Untitled PRICE REALIZED GBP 728,750.\nWelkom Willkommen Bienvenido Benvenuti Добро пожаловать クリスティーズへようこそ.\nUpcoming Lots Past Lots Related Content.\nEmail address or username Remember me.\nPassword Forgot password?.\nBrowse Categories African & Oceanic Art Ancient Art & Antiquities Asian Art Books & Manuscripts Collectibles Arms & Armor Memorabilia Musical Instruments Textiles & Costume.\nFine Art Drawings & Watercolors Paintings Sculptures, Statues & Figures Impressionist & Modern Art Post War & Contemporary Art Old Masters.\nFossils & Minerals Furniture & Decorative Arts Clocks Furniture & Lighting Porcelain Rugs & Carpets Silver.\nPhotographs, Posters, Prints & Multiples Photographs Posters, Signage & Advertising Prints & Multiples.\nJewelry & Watches Jewelry Watches.\nWine, Spirits & Cigars.\n Save Interest Name this interest: Email me when items match this interest for: Always 3 months 6 months 1 year.\nSave.\nclose Place absentee bid Place absentee bid Online absentee bidding for this sale has closed.

To mark the occasion, Anish Kapoor has been invited to create a work especially for the Museum. Anish Kapoor has chosen to show Svayambh, a monumental installation extending across the entire ground floor. This work comprises a gigantic block of red wax transported by a flatcar that gradually crosses the exhibition space on rails set 150 centimetres above the floor. Cumbrously the flatcar makes its way through the arches of the patio, leaving dramatic strips of its wax cargo on the pillars in a painful but inexorable advance that can be read as an allegory of memory and history – two themes central to the museum’s functioning. The fifteen tons of red matter that are slowly worn away by the arches speak to us of the suffering of human beings caught up in the mysterious workings of destiny. Staying true to his interest in forms produced by forces or stresses that modify an object’s shape, the artist offers a work generated by the architecture of the space. Whence the title Svayambh, a Sanskrit word whose literal meaning – something like “self-engendered, shaped by one’s own energy” – hints at the cosmic connotations underpinning the work of Anish Kapoor. From 12 October-13 January this sculpture will be shown at the Haus der Kunst in Munich. Anish Kapoor’s oeuvre is one of the landmarks of the sculpture of the last twenty years. Making its appearance in the context of the new English sculpture in the early 1980s, it at once stood out as dissenting from that of such major sculptors of the same generation as Tony Cragg and Richard Deacon. Where their work is characterised by the use of materials typical of the late industrial period, Kapoor’s has a timeless look that seems to owe its existence to inner processes of maturation. His first sculptures made his reputation with their bright coatings of pigment and the intense spirituality they seemed to radiate; since then he has been undertaking astonishingly monumental projects to which, in terms of ambition and sheer physical effect, we can only compare the achievements of American sculptors of the 70′s. He recently elaborated on an already singular vocabulary in the gigantic Marsyas, presented in the Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London: a work whose dimensions, tragic lyricism and plastic innovation left Europe stunned. Born in Bombay in 1954, Anish Kapoor lives in London. After training at the Chelsea School of Art & Design in 1977-78, he began his career in the early 80′s with an exhibition in Paris and followed up with a host of solo and group shows. He was awarded the Premio Duemila at the 1990 Venice Biennale, then the Turner Prize in 1991. He was given an Honorary Fellowship at the London Institute in 1997 and was named CBE en 2003.

{"id": 280, "data": "Into Yourself, Fall (2018) | Virtual Reality Anish Kapoor’s first virtual reality work, Into Yourself, Fall (2018), takes users on a journey through the human body, experiencing the sensation of falling into yourself via the immersive headset. Kapoor’s work seeks to simulate vertigo as a descent inside the human body, depicting a labyrinth of the inner workings of the self. Starting the journey in a forest scene, in a clearing surrounded by trees, viewers encounter a large black void in the ground. Users then travel through a complex series of tunnels with walls that appear to be made of sinewy flesh and muscle. With this work, Kapoor invites users to experience a surreal sensation of exploring the unknown, with viewers losing themselves in another realm. Working with Acute Art to design this custom made virtual space, Kapoor’s work was developed around the idea of creating a physical experience via a virtual journey, testing the limits of what is possible to experience through the technology. Into Yourself, Fall (2018) plays with the experience of wearing the headset, creating a disorientating sensation of radical introspection that is experienced physically by the viewer. Kapoor’s use of this new technology enables him to explore materiality in a virtual realm, drawing on his highly influential sculptural practice to evoke both tactility and transcendence. With a soundtrack created by the artist’s son Ishan Kapoor, Into Yourself, Fall (2018) directly transports the viewer into the artist’s own visceral virtual reality.\n Pushing the Boundaries of Virtual Reality  The artist Anish Kapoor discusses his first virtual reality work Into Yourself, Fall — an immersive journey into the unknown ‘One of the things I’m concerned with is the relationship between materiality and non-materiality,’ says artist Anish Kapoor, discussing Into Yourself, Fall — his first virtual reality work, produced in collaboration with Acute Art, which aims to create a physical sensation through a virtual journey.\n read more Viewers enter an immersive environment, traveling through a virtual forest before falling into the human body through a deep, black void. Inside, they descend a complex labyrinth of tunnels whose walls appear to be made of sinewy flesh and muscle. The experience is dizzying, making the body unfamiliar and pushing the limits of what can be experienced through virtual reality. ‘I believe we can do something technologically, if we can see it,’ says Kapoor, who cites artistic vision as the only limit to what virtual reality can do. ‘I’ve spent years looking for a state that is more material than material.’ Into Yourself, Fall, he explains, provided an opportunity to approach this state, resulting in a work that is both visceral and transcendental. Kapoor’s interest in materiality has inspired some of his best-known art: in Chicago, the reflective exterior of Cloud Gate (2006) warps and multiplies reflections, causing the physical world to shift and appear unstable. Viewed in certain conditions, the sculpture’s edge becomes indiscernible from surrounding sky. Other sculptures feature deep cavities that suggest a void — a ‘nothing’ which, Kapoor has reasoned, is nevertheless ‘something’. In other works, intense red pigment evokes internal organs and blood-filled capillaries. Into Yourself, Fall combines concerns at the heart of Kapoor’s practice, transporting viewers into their own visceral virtual reality.\n read less.\nAbout Anish Kapoor Anish Kapoor, CBE, RA, was born in Mumbai, India in 1954. He first gained recognition in the 1980s for his large-scale, biometric and geometric sculptures, created from materials including granite, marble and plaster. By the 1990s, his practice had evolved to incorporate forms that appeared to stretch, recede and distort the space around them. The approach informed major public commissions including Chicago’s Cloud Gate (2005) (colloquially known as ‘the Bean’) and Sky Mirror, exhibited at the Rockefeller Center in New York City in 2008. Red pigment features regularly in his output, evoking earth, blood and the body. Kapoor has been the subject of solo exhibitions at institutions including the Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Rome (2016), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (2012), the École National Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris (2011), and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2010). His public commissions include ArcelorMittal Orbit (2012), a permanent artwork for London’s Olympic Park, and Turning the World Upside Down (2010), for the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. Kapoor represented Britain in the 44th Venice Biennale in 1990, where he was the recipient of the Premio Duemila Prize. In 1991, he received the Turner Prize and, in 2002, received the Unilever Commission for the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern. Kapoor has lived and worked in London since the early 1970s, where he studied at Chelsea School of Art and Design.\n Hyperrealities at ArtScience Museum in Singapore Until September 26 2021 headlining the launch of the VR Gallery at the ArtScience Museum is a programme called Hyperrealities. It brings visitors on an exhilarating journey into the brilliant minds of three artists who have consistently pushed the boundaries of contemporary art practice.

The exhibition was originally due to open in March 2020 but had to be postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A number of measures, including pre-booked tickets, will be put in place following government guidelines to allow visitors to experience the works at Houghton Hall. The exhibition will feature 24 sculptures as well as a selection of drawings and smaller works representative of Kapoor’s ground-breaking body of work created over the past 40 years. Presented together, this series of works will challenge the classical architecture of the house and the idyllic beauty of the grounds, whilst being in continuous dialogue and engagement with Houghton’s history. Anish Kapoor is one of the most influential sculptors working today, known for creating ambitious public sculptures adventurous in both form and engineering across vastly different scales and materials. Curated by Mario Codognato, the exhibition at Houghton will feature some of Kapoor’s major works in mirror and stone, including Sky Mirror (2018) – a 5-metre diameter mirror of stainless steel that reflects and transforms the space around it, turning the world upside down – and a series of carved marble sculptures created in 2001 – 2003 which will be displayed across the grounds. A number of works will also be shown inside the house, including a series of dramatic sandstone sculptures which will be presented in the gallery spaces. Lord Cholmondeley, owner of Houghton, said: “Anish Kapoor is a magician. His elegant reflective pieces throw back the world in mysterious ways. We are proud to have the opportunity to present an important group of Anish Kapoor’s work at Houghton, and are delighted to be able to welcome visitors once again.” Houghton Hall was built by Sir Robert Walpole, Great Britain’s first Prime Minister in around 1722. Designed by prominent Georgian architects Colen Campbell and James Gibbs, it is one of the country’s finest examples of Palladian architecture. Houghton and its estate passed to the Cholmondeley family at the end of the 18th Century and remains a family home. The house and award-winning gardens have been open to the public since 1976. Presented by Houghton Arts Foundation. HAF continues to build a collection of contemporary art in the grounds of Houghton Hall, including a number of site-specific commissions. With links to colleges and public institutions across the region, the Foundation’s aim is for Houghton to become a focus for those who wish to see great art of our time in a historic setting. Anish Kapoor at Houghton Hall follows exhibitions of work by James Turrell (2015), Richard Long (2017), Damien Hirst (2018) and Henry Moore (2019). Presented by Houghton Hall. Sponsored by Dorotheum. With support from Lisson Gallery. Anish Kapoor Anish Kapoor was born in Mumbai, India, in 1954 and lives and works in London.

Gouaches.\nShare:.\nFrom October 22 to November 28, 2004,GAMeC will host a one-man show by the Anglo-Indian artist Anish Kapoor. A series of gouaches executed by the artist between 1995 and 2000 will be featured. On the opening day of the show, Thursday, October 21, the city of Bergamo will honor Anish Kapoor at two different events: at GAMeC, and at the Cloister of Santa Marta where a new work commissioned by the Banca Popolare di Bergamo Gruppo BPU Banca will be installed on permanent display. The gouaches exhibited at GAMeC offer a glimpse of a lesser known and almost “private” aspect of Kapoor’s activity, as he is generally known amongst the general public for his large sculptures, which often assume monumental or environmental dimensions. Considered one of the most influential artists of his generation, Kapoor’s gouaches, like his sculptures, are focused on subjects of particular interest to him, such as the interpenetration of solid and void, the notion of the infinite, the dimension of the sky, and ambivalences like concave-convex, presence-absence, and tangible-intangible. Color in Kapoor’s work becomes material and assumes a sculptural dimension: dust blurs the boundaries, eliminating the clear distinction between form and background and rendering the depth of the different planes in the form of space that can be occupied by the observer’s imagination. Anish Kapoor is one of the most important artists on the international contemporary art scene. Born in Bombay in 1954, he has lived and worked in London since the 1970’s. Since the early 1980’s, his original works, in a continuous dialogue between a two dimensional and three dimensional context, quickly established him as a leading exponent of New British Sculpture, the name given by critics to the new trend in English sculpture, in which participated artists like Cragg, Deacon, Woodrow, and Gormley . His works investigate the dialectic of opposites: man and woman, light and shadow, interior and exterior, and his use of pure color became a constant feature in his works and symbol of the synthesis between East and West. Kapoor’s development as artist has proceeded in two complementary phases. The works from the early 1980’s belong to the first: sculptural objects with forms between the abstract and the natural, completely covered by pure pigment, whose intense color conceals the origin of the object, suggesting transgression . In the 1990’s, he developed instead what could be recognized as his peculiar characteristics : increasingly monumental sculptures that represent his depiction of the void, a void rendered tangible by a cavity that is filled or by material that is emptied. Kapoor’s works have been exhibited in museums and private galleries worldwide, including the Tate Modern in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Reina Sofia in Madrid, and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. In 1990 he participated in the 44 th Venice Biennale, where he was awarded the “Premio Duemila” (which he also received in 1992). The following year he received the “Turner Prize,” and in 1992 he participated at Documenta IX with the construction Descent into Limbo. That same year, the Seville Expo commissioned the enormous architectural work Building for Void. In 2003 he exhibited at the Naples Archaeological Museum.\n » GAMeC » Aggiungi al calendario 10/22/2004 00:00 10/22/2004 23:59 DD/MM/YYYY Europe/Rome Anish Kapoor.

He also studied video at the Ecole Nationale des Arts Décoratifs, Paris and film direction in Le Fresnoy-Studio National des Arts Contemporains, Tourcoing. He lives and works in Paris. Sala's video installation Dammi i colori (\"Give me the colors\") was on display at Tate Modern in London. The installation reflects on the transformation of Tirana in 2003 by means of colors. The installation includes a conversation with Tirana's mayor, Edi Rama, a personal friend of the artist's and the force behind this transformation. Sala will participate in ROUNDTABLE: The 9th Gwangju Biennale (2012).[1] Answer Me (2008) was filmed in a Buckminster Fuller-inspired geodesic dome in Berlin, a former NSA surveillance tower, which was constructed on the Teufelsberg (Devil's Mountain).[2] He represented France at the Venice Biennale in 2013. Sala presented Le Clash (2010), Tlatelolco Clash (2011) and Doldrum (2014) as a mixed installation in Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, and in November 2014 he won the Vincent Award. He is in a relationship with Rosario, Princess of Preslav.[3][4] Exhibitions[edit] Solo exhibitions[edit] 2016 Anri Sala: Answer Me , New Museum , New York [5].\n2013 Ravel-Ravel-unRavel , French Pavilion, Biennale di Venezia.\n2011 No Formula One No Cry , The Promenade Gallery, Vlora.\nAnri Sala , Serpentine Galleries , London [6].\n2005 Dammi i Colori , DAAD-Galerie, Berlin.\nVideos, Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam.\nLong Sorrow , Nicola Trussardi Foundation , Milan.\n2004 Alfonso Artiaco, Neapel Anri Sala - Wo sich Fuchs und Hase gute Nacht sagen , Deichtorhallen , Hamburg.\n2003 Blindfold , Galerie Johnen and Schöttle, Köln.\nKunsthalle Wien, Wien Castello di Rivoli Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Turin, Italien.\n2002 Programa, Mexico City OPA ( artist-run space ), Guadalajara , Mexico.\n2000 De Appel Foundation, Amsterdam.\nGalerie Johnen and Schöttle, Cologne (with Martin Boyce) Galerie Rüdiger Schöttle, Munich (with Torsten Slama).\n2001 Galerie Chantal Croussel, Paris 2002 Hauser & Wirth, Zürich Group exhibitions[edit] 2009 \"Closer\", Beirut Art Center [7].\n2005 Situated Self , Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade.\n2004 Delay , Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam.\nSituations construites, attitudes espace d'arts contemporains , Geneva.\nutopia station: auf dem weg nach porto alegre , Haus der Kunst, Munich.\nTime Zones: Recent Film and Video , Tate Modern , London.\nPoint of View - An Anthology of the Moving Image , UCLA Hammer Museum , Los Angeles.\nPoint of View: An Anthology of the Moving Image, New Museum of Contemporary Art , New York.\nTerminal 5 In 2004, the dormant Saarinen-designed TWA Flight Center (now Jetblue Terminal 5) at JFK Airport briefly hosted an art exhibition called Terminal 5 [8] curated by Rachel K.

The show featured work, lectures and temporary installations drawing inspiration from the idea of travel — and the terminal's architecture. [10] The show was to run from October 1, 2004 to January 31, 2005 [10] — though it closed abruptly after the building itself was vandalized during the opening party.

{"id": 285, "data": "/ Biography His works investigate ruptures in language, syntax, and music in order to validate or invalidate narrative and composition... Anri Sala was born in 1974 in Tirana, Albania. He lives and works in Berlin, Germany. Anri Sala was educated at the National Academy of Arts, Tirana; at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris; and at Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains in Tourcoing. Sala’s transformative, time-based works are constructed through multiple relationships between image, architecture and sound, utilizing these as elements to fold, capsize and question experience. His works investigate ruptures in language, syntax, and music in order to validate or invalidate narrative and composition, inviting creative dislocations which generate new interpretations of history, supplanting old fictions with new, less explicit, and less duplicitous ones. Recent solo shows have been at the Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria (2021); Buffalo Bayou Park Cistern, Houston (2021); MUDAM, Luxembourg (2019); Castello di Rivoli, Turin, Italy (2019); Fundacíon Botín, Santander, Spain (2019); the Garage, Moscow, Russia (2018); Instituto Moreira Salles, Sao Paulo, Brazil; (2017-2018); Museo Tamayo, Mexico City (2017); Kaldor Public Art Projects, Sydney, Australia (2017); The New Museum (2016); Instituto Moreira Salles, Rio de Janeiro (2016); Teshima Seawall House, Benesse Art Site Naoshima, Teshima Island, Japan (2016); Haus der Kunst, Munich (2014); the French Pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale (2013); the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (2012); The Serpentine Gallery, London (2011); The Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati (2009); The Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami (2008); and the Fondazione Nicola Trussardi, Milan (2005); among other venues. Sala has received the Vincent Award (2014), the Mario Merz Prize (2014), the 10th Benesse Prize (2013), the Absolut Art Award (2011), and the Young Artist Prize at the Venice Biennale (2001). He has taken part in many group exhibitions and biennials, including the 12th Havana Biennial (2015), the Sharjah Biennial 11 (2013), representing France at the 55th Venice Biennale, Italy (2013), the 9th Gwangju Biennale (2012), documenta (13) (2012), the 29th São Paulo Biennial (2010), the 2nd Moscow International Biennale of Contemporary Art (2007), and the 4th Berlin Biennial (2006).\n His works investigate ruptures in language, syntax, and music in order to validate or invalidate narrative and composition...

The artist uses the architectural space to fold together visual, sound and tactile elements in order to generate new interpretations of history and new possibilities within an emancipatory vision of language and culture. Specifically designed for the spaces on the third floor of the Castello, this large exhibition project brings together some of the most significant filmic works created by the artist in recent years, including Ravel, Ravel (2013), Take Over (2017) and If and only if (2018). As components of an unusual orchestra, the three works will be projected in the galleries of the Castello by a complex technological mechanism created by the artist using augmented reality as a tool, able to offer visitors an immersive experience of high emotional and synaesthetic impact. According to the artist’s project, the projections will unfold along a special wall that crosses through all galleries of the space and the exhibition will take the form of a “parade,” with a flow of moving images and multiple narratives. Finally, more than a presentation of three interwoven film works, it is a projection device that becomes a unique and gigantic sculpture in movement. Anri Sala (Tirana, 1974) is a contemporary artist who lives and works in Berlin. After having lived for many years in Paris, he represented France at the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013. He studied at the National Academy of Arts from 1992 to 1996 and in 1996-98 he studied video at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. In 1998-2000 he attended the Postgraduate Studies in film directing, Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains, Tourcoing. Some most recent solo exhibitions include: The Last Resort, Garage, Moscow (2018); Anri Sala, Museo Tamayo, Mexico City (2017); Anri Sala: Answer Me, New Museum, New York (2916); NO NAMES NO TITLE, The Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Tel Aviv, Black Box: Anri Sala, The Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore, The Present Moment, Middle Hall, Haus der Kunst, Munich (2014); Ravel Ravel Unravel, French Pavilion, 55th Venice Biennale, Venice (2013); Anri Sala: Louisiana, Louisiana Museum of Art, Humlebaek; Anri Sala, Centre Pompidou, Paris (2012); Anri Sala, Serpentine Gallery, London (2011).

ensembles.” \n", "label": [[5, 9, "DATE"], [13, 28, "GPE"], [49, 55, "GPE"], [68, 77, "DATE"], [104, 110, "GPE"], [112, 121, "DATE"], [170, 175, "GPE"], [177, 186, "DATE"], [279, 288, "GPE"], [297,

{"id": 289, "data": "ANRI SALA Text by Massimiliano Gioni.\nCURA.30 Share on:\nFacebook, Twitter.\nThe first work I ever saw by Anri Sala was Intervista (Finding the Words) (1998), a video presented at the 1999 Venice Biennale in the Albanian Pavilion, curated by Edi Muka and co-organized by Edi Rama and Flash Art. I was working at the time for the Milan branch of this magazine, and Sala’s name was already being mentioned around the office as one of the young Albanian artists who were beginning to emerge after the country’s civil war in 1997. Intervista, the work made for his thesis project when Sala was a film student in Paris, stands as a milestone marking the shift between the late 1990s and the new millennium. In contrast to the ’90s generation of video art—the various neo-structuralist experiments by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Douglas Gordon, Pierre Huyghe, Philippe Parreno, and the spectacular videos of Doug Aitken and Pipilotti Rist—Sala’s video seemed very simple, almost primitive, using disarmingly humble tools and letting narrative win out over images. Intervista was a sort of detective story in which Sala tried to reconstruct the soundtrack of an old film that showed his mother talking about socialism and revolution. Like other artists of his generation, such as Phil Collins, Artur Zmijewsky, or the older Steve McQueen, Sala brought the focus back to reality, to documentary, even autobiography: a reflection on history and its traumas, but woven out of personal, private, almost confessional experiences. Along with Intervista, his subsequent Nocturnes and Dammi i Colori—which Sala showed at Manifesta in 2000 and at the 2003 Venice Biennale respectively—formed a sort of trilogy of the Balkans; they described the collapse of communism and the open wounds of history through the existential adventures of solitary characters, swept up in the flow of events and sometimes driven by delusions of grandeur. Nocturnes alternates the monologues of an obsessive aquarist, always anxious that his fish may die, with the confessions of a young veteran who seems to get reality mixed up with video games as he recounts his gruesome missions. In Dammi i Colori [“Give Me the Colors”], Edi Rama (then Mayor of Tirana, now Prime Minister of Albania) tells of how he tried to transform the capital by painting its buildings, but his monologue turns into a meditation on art as a regenerative force and utopia as poetry and politics. A psychological tension snakes through the Balkan trilogy, as if Sala’s characters were prey to a sense of instability and fragility, a sort of “borderline syndrome,” to quote the title of Manifesta 3.\n time after time, 2003 Courtesy: Bick Productions © Anri Sala / ADAGP, Paris (2019), by SIAE 2019 A similar mood can be found in Time After Time, a short video shot in the same period as Dammi i Colori and in the same streets of Tirana. We see an emaciated horse standing petrified by the divider of an almost deserted highway; it lifts one hoof every time a car passes, as if to defend itself or perhaps gallop away, yet remains inexorably frozen. Like the characters in the trilogy, the horse in Time After Time could be seen as a lone survivor of the collapse of ideology, bewildered by the sudden turn of events. The video also seems to explicitly play on the tradition of equestrian sculpture and celebratory monuments. But rather than a heroic horse and rider, Sala presents a wounded animal that transforms this work into a monument in reverse, an image of surrender. It was owing to this sense of anguish and imminent loss that Time After Time was chosen as one of the opening images in the Berlin Biennale that I curated with Ali Subotnick and Maurizio Cattelan. Sala’s work was installed on the ground floor of a former Jewish girls’ school, whose architecture served as a time capsule of 20th-century traumas. Like other coeval works, Time After Time marks an important turning point in Sala’s career; it was around this time that he abandoned the words and narrative that characterized his early videos and began to focus on more abstract images, in which sound and music almost became characters in their own right. Nowhere is this transition more evident than in Long Sorrow (2005), originally produced by the Fondazione Nicola Trussardi and presented in a solo show at Milan’s Circolo Filologico in 2005. Long Sorrow is one of Sala’s most touching and mysterious works: one long, slow take reveals the interior of an apartment in a modernist building in Berlin that residents have nicknamed the “Long Complaint,” or “Sorrow.” Outside the window we can see a saxophone player who is improvising a wild rhapsody as he hangs 30 meters off the ground, suspended like a figurehead on the prow of a building that sums up the aspirations and failures of 20th-century modernist ideology. Like many other works by Sala, Long Sorrow weaves music and architecture into a sweeping, abstract vision of history, a syncopated requiem for the great illusions that inflamed the 20th century: modernity, utopia, equality, and exceptionalism. Some of these themes turn up again in a series of video-installations that Sala has been developing in recent years, such as Ravel Ravel, presented at the Venice Biennale in 2013 and then at the New Museum in New York in 2016, or Take Over, shown in Berlin in 2017. Both of these works—large, complex installations where video and sound take on a sculptural quality—revolve around pieces of music connected to 20th-century history: respectively, Maurice Ravel’s Piano Concerto for the Left Hand in D Major (1929-1930) and the famous political anthems La Marseillese and The Internationale, which Sala takes apart and fits together like musical jigsaw puzzles. Two decades after Intervista, Sala is still reconstructing sounds and images as a way of giving a voice back to the ghosts of the past. If history had a soundtrack, its dissonances, harmonies, and cacophonies would surely resemble Sala’s aural assemblages.\n Anri Sala\nText by Massimiliano Gioni CURA.30\nCREDITS:\ntime after time, 2003\nCourtesy: Bick Productions © Anri Sala / ADAGP, Paris (2019), by SIAE 2019.\nANRI SALA (b. 1974, Tirana, Albania) currently lives and works in Berlin. Anri Sala has been working in a range of media including video, photography, installation, drawings and sculptures. His work explores the boundaries between image and sound in order to generate carefully assembled time-based moments which overlap one another. Recent shows include: Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow (2018); Kaldor Public Art Projects, Sydney (2017); Tamayo Museum, Mexico City (2017); the 57th Venice Biennale (2017); and more. His work will be shown in several upcoming solo exhibitions in 2019, including at Castello di Rivoli, Turin, Fundación Botín, Santander, and Mudam Luxembourg.
