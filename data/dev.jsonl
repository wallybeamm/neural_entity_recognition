Read More Adrian Ghenie's Early Years Born in 1977 in Baia Mare, Romania, Adrian Ghenie studied at the University of Art and Design in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, graduating in 2001. After working as an artist in Vienna and Sicily, he returned to Cluj to establish Galeria Plan B with Mihai Pop in 2005. Initiated as a platform for the presentation of contemporary Romanian artists, the gallery opened its second space in Berlin in 2008. Renaissance Mastery of Chiaroscuro to Painterly Abstraction The Romanian painter borrows stylistically from across the art historical canon, from the sombre, dramatic chiaroscuro of Renaissance painting to the Abstract Expressionists' experimentations with texture and surface. The use of a palette knife instead of a brush forms the basis of Adrian Ghenie's oil painting technique: pouring and dripping paint and making broad marks with the knife on the painted surface. The resulting oil paintings combine realistic, figurative elements with varying degrees of fragmentation and abstraction. His style has been compared to Francis Bacon. Historical Muses: From Hitler to Duchamp The intensity of the abstraction is tied to the subjects of the artist's works. A complex interplay between the historical and the personal, Adrian Ghenie's paintings examine the psychological state of individuals, principally figures of historical influence. Among Ghenie's historic subjects include instigators of great suffering, such as Hitler, Lenin, Nicolae Ceausescu, and Nazi war criminal, Josef Mengele. Others of a less violent persuasion include groundbreaking figures such as evolutionary scientist Charles Darwin and artists like Vincent van Gogh and Marcel Duchamp. Auction Success and International Representation Ghenie's distinctive practice quickly stood out on the international art scene, attracting the attention of institutions and influential collectors. Since first appearing at auction in 2011, Ghenie's oil on canvas paintings have rapidly increased in value on the secondary art market. Nickelodeon (2008), an ominous two-part painting acquired by François Pinault in 2009 for approximately €60,000, sold at Christie's for £7.1 million just seven years later. On Ghenie's development as an artist since his solo exhibition at Galerie Judin back in 2007, Juerg Judin explains to Ocula Advisory, '...you realise that an incredibly intelligent but equally courageous painter has steadily intensified his goal of achieving great narratives with ever more abstraction'. ⁠ Alongside various solo and group exhibitions in galleries and institutions across Europe and America, Adrian Ghenie has participated in numerous international biennials, including the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015, where he represented Romania. A 2021 solo exhibition of Ghenie's recent works, We Had Everything Before Us, is running at Galerie Judie, Berlin, from 1 May through to 10 July. Solo and Group Exhibitions Adrian Ghenie's solo exhibitions include The Hooligans, Pace Gallery, New York (2020); Adrian Ghenie, Tim Van Laere Gallery, Antwerp (2020); The Battle Between Carnival and Feast, Palazzo Cini Gallery, Venice (2019); Adrian Ghenie, Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga, Málaga (2014); Golems, Pace Gallery, London (2014); Pie-Fights and Pathos, Museum for Contemporary Art, Denver (2012); Adrian Ghenie, Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Ghent, (2010); Adrian Ghenie, National Museum of Contemporary Art, Bucharest (2009); and If You Open It You Get Dirty, Galeria Plan B, Cluj (2006).

La Galleria, Venice plus Apr, 19 — Nov, 18 2019.\nDuring the 2019 seasonal opening of the permanent exhibition at the Palazzo Cini Gallery, a contemporary art show dedicated to Adrian Ghenie will also be staged. Produced in collaboration with the Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, the exhibition will be installed on the second floor of the house-museum in Campo San Vio. Around ten paintings have been specifically created for this project. The title also suggests a link with the city of Venice through the reference to Carnival. In his approach to the series, the artist thus clearly looks to tradition but does so without forgoing an interest in contemporary events. Characterised by an experimental use of colour with strong physical material connotations, Ghenie’s paintings depict personalities whose actions have influenced and continue to influence the course of the history of the world. Born in Baia Mare, Romania, in 1977, Adrian Ghenie currently lives and works in Berlin. His show in the Romanian pavilion at the 56th Venice Biennale brought him international renown and his works are now on display in major museums and galleries, such as the Centre Pompidou, Paris, the Tate Modern, London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

The exhibition underscores the way in which Ghenie has been developing a consistent engagement with issues such as memory and history, by subjecting his artistic practice to a process of continuous renewal and experimentation. Ghenie is an ardent researcher of the history of the 20th century, being preoccupied with unearthing forgotten narratives, marginal events and seemingly insignificant details in order to compose a visual vocabulary that is both compelling and uncanny. The subject matter does not revolve around a single set of concerns, and yet the different themes of Ghenie’s paintings seem to connect. Spectral presences of Hitler and Lenin, collective bodies of anonymous, defaced people – are all there to reveal the feebleness and inconsistency of our memory. The failure of modernity brought about by the catastrophes of the Second World War is seen in conjunction with the rise of modern forms of entertainment such as cinema, another major topic for Ghenie. From the strong effects of chiaroscuro reminiscent of Caravaggio to the frieze-like compositions that bring to mind David Hockney’s alignment of disconnected elements alluding to a theatre set; from an indebtedness to the tradition of Renaissance painting, visible in the rigorous construction of the picture space, to the uninhibited handling of paint that recalls the gestural freedom of abstract expressionism – Ghenie incorporates a multitude of references and idioms that do not result in a gratuitous postmodern game, but rather evince his commitment to investigate the possibilities of painting, while at the same time problematizing it. Although his work displays a belief in the contemporary relevance of painting, Ghenie seeks to delve into the conceptual tenets that have undermined the legitimacy of the medium. The artist revisits key moments in the history of modernism that prompted the declaration of the death of painting. He invokes the figure of Duchamp – the foremost enemy of paint and colour who rendered the painting obsolete through the introduction of the readymade into the field of art – as well as the first International Dada exhibition in Berlin which exhibited signs declaring that art was dead.

His installations and videos explore the relationship between sight and subjectivity, apparent in his earlier works, while the more recent productions interrogate the relationship between representation and power, the image manipulation and the mediation of reality.

This book documents a selection of works by artist Adrian Ghenie (born 1977) included in his exhibition The Hooligans. The artist's newest body of work, these nine paintings and three drawings continue Ghenies exploration of abstracting figures, layering shapes and gestural painting techniques to create complex images intertwined with art historical narratives. Influenced by Impressionist painters, as well as Turner, Van Gogh and Gauguin, Ghenies meditation on the idea of hooliganism examines the role of rebellion in an artists process, working to reject or ignore traditionalism to create the new. An art historical text by Apsara DiQuinzio traces the trajectory of Ghenie's practice through to today. In her new text, Masha Tupitsyn discusses the concept of the double, looking at its history in philosophy, literature, film and art.\n PUBLISHER \nPace Publishing BOOK FORMAT \nHardcover, 8.5 x 12 in. / 80 pgs / 25 color / 3 bw.

Particularly since his spectacular exhibition in the Romanian Pavilion at the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015, Adrian Ghenie (born 1977) has been celebrated as one of the most interesting and unconventional painters of his generation. His workspainted in oils sometimes applied with a palette knife or thrown onto the canvashave already gained entry into the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tate Modern and the Centre Pompidou, and have achieved one auction record after another in the art market. Yet neither Ghenies subjects nor his technique cater to public taste. The history of the century of humiliation (as Ghenie refers to the 20th century), and its perpetrators and victims, are the predominant sources for his collage-like compositions. These subjects are juxtaposed with heroes such as Van Gogh and Darwin, as well as depictions of himself.\n PUBLISHER \nHatje Cantz BOOK FORMAT \nClth, 11 x 11.5 in. / 176 pgs / 82 color.

The title is drawn from Henri Rousseau's exhibition at Tate Modern in 20056.

Since the publication of his first monograph in 2009, Romanian artist Adrian Ghenie (born 1977) has established himself on both sides of the Atlantic as a preeminent painter of his generation, with his brutal canvases of faces slashed at, blurred, gnawed and erased. Ghenie intensifies the raw scream of Francis Bacons paintings to an even greater pitch, revisiting the Holocaust (as in one famous painting of Josef Mengele) and extending Bacons idiom of existential horror vividly into the present. Last year, his work featured in several museum exhibitions, including his first solo U.S. museum show at the MCA Denver and SFMoMAs seminal group exhibition Six Lines of Flight . In March 2013, Pace Gallery presented his critically acclaimed New York debut. While Ghenie continues to explore the darker moments in European history, social and political abuses of power, as well as his personal history, his compositions have become conspicuously more complex over the years, as he has turned increasingly toward a brighter and more colorful palette, confidently shifting between figuration and abstraction. This book unites 80 of Ghenies key works from the past four years.\n PUBLISHER \nHatje Cantz BOOK FORMAT \nClth, 11 x 11 in. / 184 pgs / 100 color.

Power and its abuse, forced exile and migration are the themes of the painting of Adrian Ghenie (born 1977). Raised amid the propaganda of Ceausescu's Romania, Ghenie has already produced a powerful body of work in response to this inheritance of deluded and abusive dictatorship--work which in the span of just a few years has already won much attention and acclaim.\n PUBLISHER \nHatje Cantz BOOK FORMAT \nClth, 11.5 x 11.25 in. / 120 pgs / 80 color.

Ai Weiwei: Defend the Future is an exhibition of Ai Weiwei (born 1957) that is dedicated to the artist's numerous artworks on the themes of freedom of expression and the lives of refugees. The artist has been highly active in a wide range of areas, from painting and photography to film, installation, architecture, public art, ceramics, and publication. Ai is also highly praised as a leading artist for his active communication via various social media channels—including his blog, Twitter, and Instagram, among others—representing today's digital era. The title of the exhibition, Defend the Future, (which is literally translated as \"The Future of Humans\" in Korean) is a combination of \"humans,\" a leading theme of Ai’s artistic agenda, and \"future,\" the artist’s main artistic pursuit. In Quotes (2019), a collection of major comments made throughout human history on the theme of human rights, Socrates stated, \"I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world,\" Ai has deeply pondered his role as a global citizen and humanism (being human) in general. Ai's life and art express that it is important for us, as dignified humans, to enjoy freedom, freedom of speech and freedom of expression, in our generation and also in future generations. His series of works on freedom of expression and resistance to oppression have demanded dignity and basic human rights from his perspective as an artist as well as a human being. Freedom of expression is the most basic right required for individuals in a society to live as “decent human beings.” The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, announced in 1948, stated, “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers” (Article 19). However, the right to freedom of expression is a right that has never actually been completely guaranteed in the real world. In Ai’s art, \"human\" is simultaneously a value to pursue and an environment and condition in which art can be made sense of in that his art and life both pursue freedom of expression and challenge oppression and surveillance. Ai has been active in encouraging people to speak out about unfair situations, and his actions have made a difference in the real world. In other words, he thinks, dreams, and works to create a reality in which we can “live the best life possible.” The exhibition will showcase Ai's representative works that transcend the dualities of the East and West, including his photography series Study of Perspectives, 1995-2011 (2014); Study of Perspective in Glass (2018) and Black Chandelier (2017–21), both in Murano glass created in collaboration with the Berengo Studio on Murano Island, Venice; Porcelain Pillar with Refugee Motif (2017) and Ruyi (2012), made from ceramics from Jingdezhen, a place known for porcelain production in China. The exhibition is expected to take visitors on a journey into the artist's time and space, allowing them to browse through some 126 pieces of Ai's representative works that ranges from a 12-meter bamboo figure reminiscent of a jade burial suit from the Han Dynasty (ca. 2000 years ago), through a documentary about the Rohingyas (stateless Indo-Aryan ethnic group residing in Myanmar), to a Neolithic Vase with Coca-Cola Logo (2015).\n Share Email Facebook Twitter Copy Link Link Copied!.\nMap.\nRSVP RSVP for Ai Weiwei: Defend the Future National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul December 9, 2021.\nThank you for your RSVP.

For this project Albert Oehlen is at the same time an artist, a curator and a collector. Iconic works embodying different phases of his painting career will be displayed alongside a selection of more than thirty international artists belonging to his private collection. It is always very interesting when artists collect art, and this is particularly true in the case of a reserved, elusive and sometimes even cryptic artist like Albert Oehlen. This is the first time that masterpieces by Oehlen are exhibited alongside works from his private art collection in such an extensive form and in a display conceived by the artist himself in partnership with MASI. This project not only offers surprising insights into his work, but also allows visitors to discover, or rediscover, a series of exceptional artists. The core group of works, representing the essence of Oehlen’s art, and the extraordinary chance to admire a part of his private collection in a museum, will enable visitors to engage with the depth and breadth of his pictorial exploration. Albert Oehlen Albert Oehlen (b. 1954) is one of the most influential contemporary painters of the international art scene. Since the 1980s he has been exploring the potential and limits of painting, constantly questioning its subjects and the methods and media that it employs, through his continuously evolving style and technique. Born in Krefeld, Germany, Oehlen studied at the Hochschule für bildende Künste in Hamburg from 1978 to 1981, and soon became a prominent figure of the Berlin and Cologne art scenes. During that time, he was considered an artist of the Junge Wilde (Young Wilds) movement, along with Martin Kippenberger and Werner Büttner, producing works that challenged the categorisation of art and rejected the art system itself. Oehlen deconstructed painting, stripping it down to its constituent parts – colour, gesture, movement and time – and advancing his artistic quest with rules and restrictions that he imposed upon his own artistic process, which offered him new starting points to continue redefining the understanding of painting. Over the years, this way of working, which Oehlen continues to use today, has led to surprising series of works that combine abstract and figurative art and different styles and techniques. Since the time of his Bad Paintings, Oehlen also features clumsiness and ugliness in his work – disturbing gestures, roughly depicted figures, artificial smudges of paint, daring and jarring colours – constantly applying pressure to the painting system and displaying infinite combinations and manipulations with which he creates new perceptive challenges for the public too.

Over the past thirty years, the tree has served as a motif within Oehlen’s work, allowing him to test the boundaries of figuration and abstraction. Albert Oehlen: Woods near Oehle includes curatorial, musical, and written contributions by four of Oehlen’s closest friends and fellow travelers—curator Julie Sylvester, artist Christopher Williams, and author and critic Diedrich Diederichsen—helping to pinpoint his diverse approach to art making. Oehlen and Swiss musician Michael Wertmüller have produced a new composition as part of a multimedia installation, also debuting in Cleveland.\nA thought-provoking and unconventional survey, including work from the past thirty years, Albert Oehlen: Woods near Oehle reflects Oehlen’s complex layering of methods, subject matter, and viewpoints, while also celebrating an artist who continues to radically question the limits of painting. In conjunction with the exhibition, the CMA produced a “box set” containing a newly pressed EP, an exhibition catalogue, and an anthology of texts and images edited by Christopher Williams, among other objects.\n Albert Oehlen: Woods near Oehle is made possible in part by a generous gift from the Scott C. Mueller Family and support from the Michelle and Richard Jeschelnig Exhibitions and Special Projects Fund and the Swiss Arts Council Pro Helvetia. The Cleveland Museum of Art is funded in part by residents of Cuyahoga County through a public grant from Cuyahoga Arts & Culture.\nThis exhibition was supported in part by the Ohio Arts Council, which receives support from the State of Ohio and the National Endowment for the Arts. .\n.\n.\nPresenting Centennial Sponsor   Supporting Centennial Sponsor   Media Sponsor.\nUntitled (Baum 57), 2015.

{"id": 56, "data": "Albert Oehlen Date/place of birth September 17, 1954, Krefeld.\nAlbert Oehlen - biography When an artist admittedly wishes to paint good pictures but presents his work under the label “Bad Paintings”, then this suggests that he doesn’t know much about the conventional categories of beauty and ugliness. In fact, the painter Albert Oehlen disbands existing references with his art and creates his own space full of new relations. (...) Continue reading.\nAlbert Oehlen – Provocations, unintentional Albert Oehlen was born on 17 September 1954 in Krefeld, the eldest son of the caricaturist Adolf Oehlen. Albert inherited his father’s artistic talent and the study of art was inevitable. His teachers at the University of Fine Arts in Hamburg were Claus Böhmle and Sigmar Polke. Already early on in his artistic career he caused a sensation together with his friend and colleague Werner Büttner, when he excited the public with a pornographic detail in a mural created especially for the bookshop “Welt”. The artists denied however any intention behind the scandal and amended the mural. Again with Büttner, Albert Oehlen founded the “Liga zur Bekämpfung widersprüchlichen Verhaltens” (League against contradictory behavior), which of course did not stop him from repeatedly constructing his own works from an intriguing net of greatly varying contradictions. However, even with pictures such as his infamous “Selbstporträt mit verschissener Unterhose und blauer Mauritius” (Self-portrait with Shitty Underpants and Blue Mauritius), Oehlen strongly rejected any implication of provocation. With the combination of feces and precious objects, the artist stated, unmoved, that he merely wanted to prompt his public to a deeper interpretation. Multimedia artist with a focus on painting It is not surprising that with such a casual attitude, Albert Oehlen quickly rose to become an important constituent of the “Neuen Wilden” movement. The artist himself cared little about such descriptions, found the majority of the attempts to categorise his work silly, and despite all the humorous-parodistic formulations, saw himself as a serious painter. Although painting remained at the centre of his creative process, it didn’t make up the entire work. As one of the first multi-media artists, Albert Oehlen also produced computer pictures, and although in the light of today’s continually advancing technology seem somewhat naïve, they have yet retained a certain independent fascination. Oehlen often conceives his works serially, letting picture follow picture, thereby composing visual suites which drive the viewer ahead making a concrete interpretation and categorisation as difficult as possible. The artist names his enthusiastic experiments “postungegenständlich” (post-non-figurative), but away from these framework extensions, he always returns to his starting point, that of classical painting on canvas. Continued international success Albert Oehlen also attracted great attention beyond the German art scene. He exhibited all over the world and was accepted into public collections. The Düsseldorf Art Academy honoured him with a professorship which he held from 2000 to 2009. He also received prizes and special awards, such as an honorary doctorate from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2015. In the same year he curated an exhibition of his own and other works in the Essen Folkwang Museum – a welcome chance for Oehlen to make new contacts and to allow his own art to communicate with that of other artists. Albert Oehlen lives and works in Switzerland. His younger brother Markus Oehlen is also a successful artist. © Kunsthaus Lempertz Albert Oehlen - Works that have already been sold at Kunsthaus Lempertz: Albert Oehlen - Industrielle Elfen.\nAlbert Oehlen - Untitled.\nAlbert Oehlen - The green door.\nAlbert Oehlen - Ohne Titel.\nAlbert Oehlen - Home Grown.\nAlbert Oehlen - Ohne Titel.\nAlbert Oehlen - Ohne Titel (Konstruktion).\nCarl Wuttke - Kapelle an der italienischen Küste.\nAlbert Oehlen - Strandszene.\nMartin Kippenberger Albert Oehlen Werner Büttner Portfolio - Malen ist Wahlen.\nWorks by Albert Oehlen buy Buy works by Albert Oehlen in our upcoming auctions!

Gagosian's LA gallery space is right off of Rodeo Drive, so you really get the full \"LA experience\" when you visit. Gagosian Beverly Hills This exhibit is the second part of “his version of the Rothko Chapel in Houston as well as other new paintings.” To read more about the first part of the exhibit at Serpentine Gallery in London, see my blog post here. Albert Oehlen at Gagosian The Rothko Chapel in Houston is an environment that plays with the relationship between art and architecture, as well as the spiritual and physical realms. Oehlen creates these large scale works (similar to Rothko’s) that become equal with the building they're displayed in. Albert Oehlen at Gagosian Albert Oehlen at Gagosian A key difference in this exhibit and the one at Serpentine was Oehlen’s use of many different kinds of materials. He incorporates more than just a variety of paint, but fabrics as well. Albert Oehlen at Gagosian Albert Oehlen at Gagosian “In the large-scale canvases on view at the Beverly Hills gallery, Oehlen employs acrylic, spray paint, charcoal, and patterned fabric to interpret and transform John Graham’s painting Tramonto Spaventoso (Terrifying Sunset) (1940–49), a work by the Russian-born American modernist painter that he discovered in the 1990s and has been fascinated with ever since.” - Gagosian (source) Albert Oehlen at Gagosian Albert Oehlen at Gagosian Albert Oehlen at Gagosian Like many abstract figurative painters, Oehlen strikes the perfect equilibrium between freedom and stability in his form. “While championing self-consciously amateurish “bad” painting, Oehlen continues to infuse expressive gesture with Surrealist attitude, openly disparaging the quest for reliable form and stable meaning.”  - Gagosian (source) Albert Oehlen at Gagosian Albert Oehlen at Gagosian Albert Oehlen at Gagosian Video Walkthrough To see a walkthrough of the exhibit, see the video below. About the Artist - Albert Oehlen Albert Oehlen is a German artist who lives and works in Bühler, Switzerland and Segovia, Spain. He studied at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg in Germany. Albert Oehlen at Gagosian “Albert Oehlen’s oeuvre is a testament to the innate freedom of the creative act. Through expressionist brushwork, surrealist methodology, and self-conscious amateurism he engages with the history of abstract painting, pushing the basic components of abstraction to new extremes.” - Gagosian (source) Albert Oehlen at Gagosian \"Qualities that I want to see brought together: delicacy and coarseness, color and vagueness, and, underlying them all, a base note of hysteria.\" —Albert Oehlen (source) Albert Oehlen at Gagosian To get an idea of this market value, His current auction record is $7,542,157, for a painting that sold at a Sotheby's auction in London in 2019.

The show is comprised of two concurrent presentations, one at Galerie Max Hetzler in London, on view through November 16, 2019, and one at Nahmad Contemporary in New York, opening on November 5, 2019. The exhibition coincides with a solo show of the artist’s work at the Serpentine Gallery, London (Oct.2, 2019– Feb.2, 2020.) Spanning eight years, from 1982 – 1990, this series straddles a decisive period for the artist, during which he moved from the crude figuration and “bad painting” of the late 1970s and early 80s, towards non-objective painting in the late 1980s. Through the Spiegelbilder, Oehlen cemented his reputation for subverting painting conventions. One of Oehlen’s earliest bodies of work, the Spiegelbilder (‘Mirror Paintings’) are distinguished by actual pieces of mirror collaged onto the surface of the canvas, highlighting the artist’s unconventional approach to painting from the outset. Although visually distinct, there is an attitude and approach in these paintings towards colour, light, scale and line that carries through later series. Belonging to the Spiegelbilder are some of Oehlen’s first self-portraits, primary examples of which will also be exhibited. Many of the works in the series depict domestic interiors and politically-charged exteriors in a palette of muted colours. With titles alluding to Germany’s past and the incorporation of social and political spaces such as museums, staircases and brick walls as barrier motifs, Oehlen demonstrates his ability to turn controversy into cliché. “I only used mirrors in pictures depicting rooms, so that the viewer can place himself in the room. These rooms were chosen not on the basis of design, or architecture, or any other such criteria, but on the basis of their meaning, which I attribute to them in relation to society. Museum, apartment, Hitler’s headquarters, things like that: a summons to appear in the picture.” \n  –– Albert Oehlen Outsmarting painted pictorial reality with actual mirrored reality, the Spiegelbilder redefine the limits of the medium, drawing us in physically through their reflective qualities. Ambiguous in their presentation of socio-political spaces, the works provide early insight into Albert Oehlen’s idiosyncratic approach to painting through an ever-evolving style and technique. Albert Oehlen (*1954, Krefeld) lives and works in Switzerland. His first solo exhibition at Galerie Max Hetzler was in 1981 and he has had 25 solo shows at the gallery since. Trance, a solo show of Albert Oehlen’s paintings is currently on view at the Aïshti Foundation, Beirut through to the end of September 2019. The Kunstmuseum St. Gallen presents UNFERTIG, a solo exhibition of the artist’s work from 6 July through 10 November 2019. Oehlen's work has been shown in numerous solo exhibitions in international institutions, including Palazzo Grassi, Venice (2018); Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Havana (2017); Cleveland Museum of Art and Guggenheim, Bilbao (both 2016); New Museum, New York and Kunsthalle Zürich (both 2015); Museum Wiesbaden (2014); mumok, Vienna (2013); Kunstmuseum Bonn (2012); Carré d'Art de Nîmes (2011); Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (2009); Whitechapel Gallery, London (2006); MOCA, Miami; Kunsthalle Nürnberg (both 2005); Musée Cantonal des Beaux Arts, Lausanne; Domus Artium (2002), Salamanca and Secession, Vienna (all 2004), among others. Paintings by Albert Oehlen are held in the permanent public collections of prominent international museums including Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Kunstmuseum Bonn; Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean, Luxembourg; Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig, Vienna; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Art Institute of Chicago; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; The Broad, Los Angeles and Tate Gallery, London.\n NAHMAD CONTEMPORARY\n 980 Madison Avenue | Third Floor\n New York NY 10075 Monday - Saturday 10AM - 6PM For Press Inquiries:\n Capucine Milliot\ncapucine@nahmadcontemporary.com.\nAlbert Oehlen Albert Oehlen: Spiegelbilder November 5, 2019 - January 25, 2020.\nNew York Times What to See Right Now in New York Art Galleries January 15, 2020 \n", "label": [[90, 99, "ARTIST"], [111, 124, "ARTIST"], [153, 172, "GALLERY"], [174, 180, "GPE"], [183, 188, "GPE"], [191, 197, "GPE"], [275, 288, "ARTIST"], [317, 337, "GALLERY"], [338, 344, "GPE"], [347, 352, "GPE"], [355, 361, "GPE"], [418, 427, "ARTIST"], [439, 452, "ARTIST"], [481, 500, "GALLERY"], [502, 508, "GPE"], [511, 516, "GPE"], [519, 525, "GPE"], [569, 582, "ARTIST"], [584, 592, "WORK_OF_ART"], [594, 598, "DATE"], [665, 678, "ARTIST"], [707, 726, "GALLERY"], [728, 734, "GPE"], [737, 742, "GPE"], [745, 751, "GPE"], [768, 786, "ARTIST"], [787, 800, "ARTIST"], [802, 810, "WORK_OF_ART"], [812, 816, "DATE"], [883, 896, "ARTIST"], [925, 944, "GALLERY"], [946, 952, "GPE"], [955, 960, "GPE"], [963, 969, "GPE"], [986, 1004, "ARTIST"], [1006, 1025, "GALLERY"], [1051, 1079, "EVENT"], [1105, 1107, "GPE"], [1157, 1170, "ARTIST"], [1183, 1217, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1281, 1300, "GALLERY"], [1304, 1310, "GPE"], [1328, 1345, "DATE"], [1358, 1377, "GALLERY"], [1381, 1389, "GPE"], [1402, 1418, "DATE"], [1490, 1508, "GALLERY"], [1510, 1516, "GPE"], [1518, 1542, "DATE"], [1554, 1565, "DATE"], [1572, 1583, "DATE"], [1720, 1725, "DATE"], [1736, 1739, "DATE"], [1784, 1789, "DATE"], [1803, 1816, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1818, 1824, "ARTIST"], [1893, 1899, "ARTIST"], [1931, 1965, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2302, 2315, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2328, 2334, "ARTIST"], [2556, 2563, "GPE"], [2687, 2693, "ARTIST"], [3137, 3150, "ARTIST"], [3223, 3236, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3429, 3442, "ARTIST"], [3526, 3539, "ARTIST"], [3542, 3546, "DATE"], [3548, 3555, "GPE"], [3576, 3587, "GPE"], [3618, 3637, "GALLERY"], [3645, 3649, "DATE"], [3701, 3707, "EVENT"], [3724, 3737, "ARTIST"], [3778, 3795, "GALLERY"], [3797, 3803, "GPE"], [3826, 3840, "DATE"], [3846, 3868, "MUSEUM"], [3878, 3886, "EVENT"], [3932, 3963, "DATE"], [3965, 3971, "ARTIST"], [4064, 4078, "MUSEUM"], [4080, 4086, "GPE"], [4088, 4092, "DATE"], [4095, 4125, "MUSEUM"], [4127, 4133, "GPE"], [4135, 4139, "DATE"], [4142, 4165, "MUSEUM"], [4170, 4180, "MUSEUM"], [4182, 4188, "GPE"], [4195, 4199, "DATE"], [4202, 4212, "MUSEUM"], [4214, 4222, "GPE"], [4227, 4244, "MUSEUM"], [4251, 4255, "DATE"], [4258, 4274, "MUSEUM"], [4276, 4280, "DATE"], [4283, 4288, "MUSEUM"], [4290, 4296, "GPE"], [4298, 4302, "DATE"], [4305, 4321, "MUSEUM"], [4323, 4327, "DATE"], [4330, 4350, "MUSEUM"], [4352, 4356, "DATE"], [4359, 4399, "MUSEUM"], [4401, 4405, "DATE"], [4408, 4427, "GALLERY"], [4429, 4435, "GPE"], [4437, 4441, "DATE"], [4444, 4448, "MUSEUM"], [4450, 4455, "GPE"], [4457, 4476, "GALLERY"], [4483, 4487, "DATE"], [4490, 4519, "MUSEUM"], [4521, 4529, "GPE"], [4531, 4543, "GALLERY"], [4545, 4549, "DATE"], [4552, 4575, "GALLERY"], [4577, 4583, "GPE"], [4589, 4593, "DATE"], [4623, 4636, "ARTIST"], [4727, 4750, "MUSEUM"], [4752, 4757, "GPE"], [4759, 4799, "MUSEUM"], [4801, 4817, "MUSEUM"], [4819, 4843, "MUSEUM"], [4845, 4854, "GPE"], [4856, 4890, "MUSEUM"], [4892, 4902, "GPE"], [4904, 4941, "MUSEUM"], [4943, 4949, "GPE"], [4951, 4977, "MUSEUM"], [4979, 4990, "GPE"], [4992, 5012, "MUSEUM"], [5014, 5022, "GPE"], [5024, 5052, "MUSEUM"], [5054, 5088, "MUSEUM"], [5090, 5099, "MUSEUM"], [5101, 5112, "GPE"], [5117, 5129, "GALLERY"], [5131, 5137, "GPE"], [5140, 5159, "GALLERY"], [5195, 5206, "GPE"], [5314, 5327, "ARTIST"], [5328, 5341, "ARTIST"], [5343, 5356, "EVENT"], [5357, 5392, "DATE"], [5434, 5442, "GPE"], [5457, 5473, "DATE"]]}

Katz created iconic paintings documenting the American scene and later the American landscape through understated but monumental glimpses of the vernacular world.

After returning from a period in the navy in 1946, he enrolled at Cooper Union School of Art in New York City. In 1949 he attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, where he began to work more closely from the landscape. When Katz moved to Manhattan in 1950, Abstract Expressionism was the reigning style, and he and such figurative artists as Fairfield Porter, Philip Pearlstein, and Jane Freilicher struggled against the prevailing artistic trend. Indeed, Katz at first rendered the figure in a painterly style, looking to the example of Abstract Expressionism. This manner of painting quickly gave way in the mid-1950s to a flatter, more reductive way of painting. He painted many pictures of his wife, Ada, and many group portraits in this stylized manner against flat, unmodulated coloured backgrounds. His canvases increased in size throughout the 1960s and ’70s, and he produced a number of multipaneled paintings. His great admiration for Henri Matisse and the School of Paris is evident in his work, as is his interest in the American vernacular tradition from the Ashcan School through Pop art.

Take this quiz to see if you can match these lesser-known paintings to their creators.\n In addition to painting, Katz experimented early on with collage and made lithographs and screen prints. In the 1960s he also began to make freestanding cutout figures and to design costumes and sets for choreographer Paul Taylor. Their collaboration lasted nearly three decades. Katz’s work from the 1990s is dominated by simple views of nature: the leaves of a tree, light flickering on water, shadows, and flowers—all rendered in his characteristically pared-down painting style. Katz had his first museum retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City in 1986. He donated much of his art to the Colby College Museum of Art in Waterville, Maine, which dedicated an entire wing to his work. Katz continued to paint and make prints in the 21st century. Through arresting colours, surprising angles, and careful depictions of expression, gesture, and style, his portraits, landscapes, and still lifes remained engaging and current. His later work includes the series Calvin Klein Girls and Coca-Cola Girls (both 2018) as well as a number of public artworks (Park Avenue Departure and Metropolitan Faces [both 2019]).\n Lisa S.

{"id": 101, "data": "Skip to main content Skip to search.\nAlex Katz on his works, worries and wife Exclusive interview with the artist on the eve of his exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery The artist Alex Katz spoke exclusively to Phaidon.com about his works, worries and wife.  On Alex Katz: Portraits at the National Portrait Gallery The works on show are portraits and they’re all working with frontal light, which eliminates a lot of details and flattens the form out.  I worked a lot like that in the ’50s so it’s nice to go back to it with a different technique. One Flight Up which I did in the late '60s [1968] which has 30 heads and faces - fronts and backs - will also be on display together with paintings from the ’70s and ’80s and some transferring from the Timothy Taylor Gallery.  The works that will be on show are my top choices from my personal collection. My painting of Anna Wintour [US Editor of Vogue Magazine] is attracting a lot of attention and that will be hung by itself at the exhibition.  Anna Wintour She was very nice, very easy, very pleasant.  I was told it was her first time being painted, which is kind of amazing.  It was actually Alexander Nairne’s idea [director of the National Portrait Gallery] for me to paint Anna.  I think the painting is terrific and I know Anna thinks so too. It’s interesting, because both Anna and I cut our ties at an early age and just went into these fugitive occupations at full blast.  She really works hard and I do too.  It’s like going into a place where there’s no floor. You have to either do it or die.  That’s what painting is to me, there’s no floor, there’s no retreat – I’ve just got to do it.  Working practice I paint everyday.  I work seven days a week.  I need a large space to work – at least 35ft wide.  In the winter I work in a space that is about 50 x 45ft, with a ceiling height that accommodates a 12ft painting, which is important to me. In the summer I paint in my studio in Maine, which is on a pond - a four-mile pond.  That studio has an even higher ceiling and is about 30 x 50ft.  It has big windows on both sides, so it’s like painting outdoors – it’s a fabulous studio!  I love the light there.  My summer studio faces south, and the sun sort of moves around it. The studio is just the way I want it – it’s very controlled. I like the size, the light, it’s clean – it’s a very pleasant and harmonious environment. The sketches I do can happen at any time, day or night.  I’ve painted at night in the middle of New York City because I wanted something.  Once I was in a park and a guy said: ‘Hey that’s a very nice painting, I’d like to buy it.’  I said: ‘Oh I can’t sell it to you - I’m an amateur!’  He would have been very embarrassed if I’d told him the price for it! These days I start painting in the morning and paint throughout the day.  It starts with an idea of what I think art should be. Then I find something that correlates with it outside of me; if it’s an action or something like that I’ll make pen and ink sketches; if it’s something like a landscape then I go from the sketch to a cartoon which I paint directly on to the canvass. For my portraits I make a finished drawing from the sketch and call the model in later and correct it; then I enlarge it to a cartoon and transfer it.  I pre-mix all the colours and pick out the brushes I need so when I start to paint everything is prepared: the drawing is on the canvass, I have the sequence figured out and I just do it. It normally takes three to six hours to do a painting like one of these [going on display at the NPG]  Developing over the years I’m doing what I want to do now and I’m doing it flat out, but I never thought I’d be a full time painter. I couldn’t believe I got in to The Cooper Union [the prestigious art school].  And I said from now on I’m going to be serious with my life and I worked so hard. I left art school in ’49, so I’ve been painting professionally for 60 years.  America’s wars never got so bad to stop me, so I could continually paint and most artists haven’t had the luck to paint for that length of time. When I started out in the ’50s the best you could hope for was some teaching position, but I knew I wanted to be a painter.  I painted a lot from photographs during the ’50s, but it was just like painting landscapes - very generalised. I concentrated more on portraits in the ’60s.  By the ’80s I was doing works to show how people relate to people and showed people touching each other. I didn’t want to paint landscape pieces for the rest of my life.  I really wanted to do something new. Most painters do that.  I feel I’m better than most painters or at least I want to try. In the '90s I went back to large landscapes but I got the idea of making an environmental landscape.  Most landscapes are in the distance, so the idea was a wrap-around painting – one that wraps around you so that you’re in the landscape.  They developed into 10 x 20ft paintings.  It was a lot fun! I’ve been painting a long time.  I’ve seen a lot of art movements come and go.  Painting is sort of like fashion, it changes every few years.  I like fashion and I like painting.  I started in the '70s when it was out of fashion to do fashion.  There are a lot of people who think art is a joy forever - meaning it should stay the same, but paintings change - the new ones and the old ones.  Our responses to them changes and we grade them differently.  Seeing the light I’m technically better than I was 20 years ago, and I experimented more then.  Now I’m more focused.  These days if I get a good idea I’ll just work on it.  If something’s wrong or dull I just change the light.  Light is usually the answer!  I used to use a cross light and now I use a frontal light and it changes things quite a bit. I’m a colourist but I don’t think of it as colour, I think of it as light.  You have to get the light right and colour’s the way to do it. I start with an idea, see something that correlates and then just do it.  Some things take years because they require a lot of control. I wanted to paint a whole beach scene with a lot of people but I couldn’t figure out how to do it for years.  One summer I realised that there are gestures you can only capture with a camera - non-repetitive gestures.  So I got my daughter-in-law to get me a camera and told her to set it for a 14 year old!  Every afternoon I would go out and take pictures and then make paintings of them. At the end of three years, I got a run that was really successful but by then I wasn’t interested anymore, and I’ve never taken photos since.  Taking photos in that way gave me something I couldn’t get any other way.  There are a lot of things I can’t get at that are better done with a camera or movie.  Fear of genius I was intimidated by the 19th century idea of genius and I knew I was no genius; I thought you had to be a genius to be a painter or forget it.  I think Picasso had doubts about whether he was a genius instead of accepting he was a great painter. I dealt with the fear of genius when I got connected with myself, with the outdoor paintings I was doing.  I felt such a rush and I thought I don’t care anymore.  I thought I’m going flat out for this.  I’m not going to teach and I’m certainly not going to be a commercial artist.  I figured I could be a successful illustrator in three years and to be a painter I figured it would take seven or eight years. Looking back I did what was right for me.  It’s sort of like Dante trying to get through the woods.  At first you can’t find your way and then it clears and you find yourself drawing and painting.  I felt like I’d been lied to and I wish I hadn’t had that 19th century genius idea tossed at me.  I would have felt more secure. Now I think I’m a great painter!  I’ve no doubts about it.  I can put my paintings with other great paintings; they’re certainly not better than someone like Matisse’s but they’re pretty good.  Move over Monet – Katz does water lilies I’ve done a big series of water lilies. I’m going to show them this summer at the Farnsworth Museum.  The water lilies are on the pond in Maine and I’ve been looking at them for 50 years but I never touched them because of Monet.  I feel pretty good about them now but at first I only saw Monet’s lilies and I couldn’t figure out how to do them. But I said you’re going to do it, and I just did it. I feel like I’ve been moving towards hard edges in the last 10 years.  When I started doing some of those big landscapes some of those strokes were very hard edged and it looked ok, and I got thinking about edges and hard edges and I realize how a really good painter can paint a hard edge and it doesn’t become descriptive - when it’s descriptive it has no interior mass or volume.  Picasso’s edge on a square is dense, Stuart Davies edge on a square is thin and the form becomes thin.  Ben Duesenberg doesn’t have the density on the edge.  I was at a show and I noticed Velázquez had put a tight edge on a leg and it should have been thin which should have collapsed the body but it didn’t because of his skill.  So I said I’m going to try it. These water lilies all have fairly tight hard edges.  You’ve got to take a chance and seeing how good you are.  I’m restless and if I don’t take risks I just get bored and disgusted with myself.  The quality goes down.  If I’m working on a series it will start off rough and by the time I get to the seventh or eighth painting it’s really good and then I’m bored and it’s time to move on.  ‘My wife could nail Miss America!’ My wife, Ada, is my muse.  It just sort of turned out that way.  She’s like Dora Maar [Picasso’s muse and lover].  She’s a perfect model - a European-American beauty.  If she was two inches taller she could nail Miss America!  When she was young she went to the movies and was very influenced - all her gestures come out of movies; she’s like a dancer, she doesn’t make a bad gesture.  I am really lucky! I could use her in many different ways and now as an older glamorous woman.  She’s perfect.  She’ll still stop traffic.  It’s perfect casting.  Most of the people I paint are cast into roles and I’m the director. Vivien, my son Vincent’s wife, has taken over my wife Ada’s part.  Vivien is Brazilian and in Brazil she’s considered attractive but in New York she’s dynamite!  The artist's artist Art has five audiences: You’ve got the general educated public, and they seem to like me. You have the painters and who are my primary audience - painters and poets seem to like my work a lot. Then you have collectors. When I started no one was interested in my paintings, it was only artists who were buying them for the first 15 years; then strangers started buying them. Then there are the dealers who see a paintings differently and I’m fairly attractive to dealers. Finally there are the institutions and art historians who generally think my work is too radical.  A lot of art historians are involved in the avant-garde, which has been over for a long time from where I am.  It’s taken 20 years for them to catch on to my big heads. I always wanted to do something new, it’s instinctive for me. I wanted to make a painting that looked new I don’t believe in making paintings that are just art.  There’s a story I remember my mother telling.  I was painting and my brother asked my mother: ‘Why is Alex painting the backs of heads?’  And my mother said: ‘Because everyone now is painting faces and as you know Alex is always ahead of everybody!’  What’s next I’ve got a big show coming up at the end of June at the Farnsworth Museum, which will be all new paintings that have never been shown before and will include my water lilies series. I started some flower paintings last summer focusing on certain descriptive information and leaving the rest as generalized forms.  You can’t look at any one thing for any length of time, you’re eye is moving all over the place in continuous motion. I did a flower painting that started small but ended up being 6 x 12ft.  It looks similar to something I did 15 years ago but there are a lot of differences with it.  This summer I’m going to work on painting a lot of different coloured flowers in this way.  Advice for aspiring painters You’ve got to paint six days a week, six hours a day; you do that for six or seven years and you find out where you’re at.  Painting needs a terrific application of energy, at least for me anyway. Also, if you don’t read what’s going on you’re never going to be a painter because you have to have some knowledge of things.  You probably have to discard 50% of what you read by art historians but the other 50% you have to work on, you work for it or against it. When I learnt to draw, I drew around the clock for a couple of years.  If I wasn’t eating or in school, I was drawing; I’d draw on dates and I’d be drawing at four in the morning coming back on the subway. With the application of mental and physical energy you can get better.\n Alex Katz          :  Revised & expanded edition     Survey by Carter Ratcliff, Interview by Robert Storr, Focus by Iwona Blazwick, Artist's Writings by Alex Katz, Update by Barry Schwabsky  About thebook Alex Katz is a towering figure in contemporary painting, a key New York-based artist since the early 1960s.

Jones, one of the most noted and recognized modern-dance choreographers of our time. Executed in Katz’s bold and simplified signature style, Bill 2 depicts Jones’ visage, through a series of distinct expressions. The repetition of his face has a cinematic and lyrical quality, reinforcing his place in the world of dance, music and film. Portions of the face are dramatically cropped, giving the viewer only quick and gestural glimpses of Jones. Bill 2, is a striking homage to two artists, Katz and Jones, both renowned in their respective fields of visual and performing arts. The mural’s proximity to the new Conrad Prebys Performing Arts Center gives a nod to the interconnected worlds of art, music, and dance.\nAlex Katz is an American figurative artist best known for his paintings, sculptures, and prints. Katz was born in 1927 in Brooklyn and raised in St. Albans, Queens. He studied art at The Cooper Union, New York, and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. In the early 1960s, influenced by films, television, and billboard advertising, Katz began making large-scale paintings with cropped faces. Working almost equally in portraiture and landscape, his recognizable style incorporates bright colors and boldly simplified compositions. While most well known for depicting his wife, Ada, many of his other subjects are fellow artists, poets, art critics, and dancers.\nKatz's work has been the subject of more than 200 solo exhibitions and nearly 500 group exhibitions internationally since 1951. His work can be found in over 100 public collections worldwide including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo; The Art Institute of Chicago; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; The National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Albertina Graphische Sammelung, Austria; the Musée National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France; The Tate Gallery, London, England and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, Japan.

{"id": 107, "data": "Alex Katz Art American, b. 1927 Flat color and minimal forms contrast the often monumental scales of the paintings by Alex Katz through which he creates portraits and landscapes of deceptive simplicity. Although the signature stark style that defines his prints and other work is now recognizable at a glance, it took him a decade to develop. During that time, he has said he destroyed hundreds of paintings. Born in Brooklyn, New York, to Russian émigré parents, Katz’s family moved to Queens when he was a baby and that is where his family’s passion for the arts supported his early creative interests. In 1946, he enrolled at the Cooper Union in Manhattan where he studied painting under Morris Kantor. While he was influenced by the bold colors and hard edges of modernism, he shifted away from the then-dominant Abstract Expressionism movement to figurative scenes of life that have an inherent cool in their pared-down approach. Especially impactful were Katz’s summer studies between 1949 and 1950 at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, a place where, as he later wrote: “I tried plein air painting and found my subject matter and a reason to devote my life to painting.” Katz’s first solo show was in 1954 at Roko Gallery in New York. He experimented over the course of the following years with collage and painting on aluminum sheets, with his work in the 1960s drawing inspiration from film and advertising. In the 1970s, Katz expanded into portrait groups that regularly depicted the cultural scene of New York; in the 1980s, he extended his focus to fashion and its supermodels. Since the late 1950s, an enduring muse for his portraits has been his wife, Ada, while others have painted friends and famous figures. The intimate closeness of the frequently cropped faces in Katz’s portraits exudes a sense of tension with the subjects’ enigmatic expressions and planes of color. In the 1960s, Katz collaborated with American dancer and choreographer Paul Taylor on sets and costumes. His concentration on landscapes emerged in the late 1980s, with atmospheric night views joining his practice, which had previously been defined by bright colors. Always finding new perspectives on his work, he has explored using iPhone photographs as the basis for large-scale compositions in recent years. Katz’s prolific career has spanned sculpture, prints and public art along with his paintings and drawings, and his works can be found in the collections of leading museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art and Museum of Modern Art. He has had over 250 solo exhibitions around the world and continues to be acclaimed. In 2022, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum plans to open a major retrospective of his art.

{"id": 112, "data": "Skip to content Serpentine Galleries → What’s On → Alex Katz: Quick Light.\nAlex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © readsreads.info Alex Katz: Quick Light Serpentine Gallery 2 Jun — 11 Sep 2016 Free.\nThe Serpentine presented the work of renowned American painter Alex Katz (b. 1927, Brooklyn, New York).  This exhibition brought together Katz’s extraordinarily productive output of recent years alongside works from across his career, in an installation that responded and related to the unique context of the Serpentine Gallery.  Coming of age as an artist in 1950s New York, Katz developed his unique approach to contemporary representational painting during the height of Abstract Expressionism. Over the five and a half decades since his first exhibition in 1954, Katz has produced a celebrated body of work, including paintings, drawings, sculpture and prints. Establishing himself as a pre-eminent painter of modern life, he was influenced by films, billboard advertising, music, poetry and his close circle of friends and family. His portraits and landscapes are characterised by their flatness of colour and fluidity of line, reinventing both genres within the context of abstract painting and contemporary image-making. The Serpentine exhibition took landscape as its focus, bringing together Katz’s extraordinarily productive output of recent years alongside select works from the past two decades. Katz’s landscape paintings exemplify his life-long quest to capture the present tense in paint. Regardless of their scale, Katz describes these paintings as ‘environmental’ in the way in which they envelop the viewer. Defined by temporal qualities of light, times of the day and the changing of the seasons, these paintings responded and related to the unique context of the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens. The exhibition also included a recent series of portraits. Installed outside the Serpentine Gallery Ada, (wind vane) is a flat sculpture which is part of Alex Katz’s ‘cut-outs’ – a body of work that dates back to 1959 when he began to cut out figures from his paintings to emphasise the two-dimensionality of painting. The sculpture is a functioning wind vane and a freestanding portrait of the artist’s wife and life-long muse, Ada, who is the subject of many of his works, including a painting in the exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery. Inspired by billboard advertising and the experience of going to the cinema, Katz characteristically employs an oversized format in his painted and sculptural portraits in order to play with the viewer’s sense of scale. This sculpture expanded the exhibition Quick Light beyond the walls of the Gallery, connecting Katz’s work with the Serpentine’s parkland surroundings. Katz draws parallels between his approach to painting and his interest in poetry, both equally concerned with stripping away unnecessary detail to leave only the essential information. This relationship between language and the painting process was echoed in the work of painter, poet and filmmaker Etel Adnan, shown in parallel at the Serpentine North Gallery, whose landscapes are similarly defined by their bold colour and simplified form that is nevertheless rooted in keen observation of the world around her.\n Serpentine Gallery 2 Jun — 11 Sep 2016 Free.\nShare Share on Facebook Share on Twitter.\nSupporters.\nAlex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © readsreads.info Alex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © readsreads.info Alex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © Tristan Fewings / Getty Alex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © readsreads.info Alex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © readsreads.info Alex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © readsreads.info Alex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © readsreads.info Alex Katz: Quick Light; Installation view; Serpentine Gallery, London (2 June – 11 September 2016); Image © readsreads.info Alex Katz Ada, (wind vane) 2016 Porcelain enamel on shaped steel (two sided), mounted on powder-coated steel base 368.3 x 147.32 cm.

According to Calder's mother, Nanette (née Lederer), Calder was born on August 22, yet his birth certificate at Philadelphia City Hall, based on a hand-written ledger, stated July 22. When Calder's family learned of the birth certificate, they asserted with certainty that city officials had made a mistake. Calder's grandfather, sculptor Alexander Milne Calder, was born in Scotland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1868, and is best known for the colossal statue of William Penn on Philadelphia City Hall's tower. His father, Alexander Stirling Calder, was a well-known sculptor who created many public installations, a majority of them in Philadelphia. Calder's mother was a professional portrait artist, who had studied at the Académie Julian and the Sorbonne in Paris from around 1888 until 1893. She moved to Philadelphia, where she met Stirling Calder while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Calder's parents married on February 22, 1895. Alexander Calder's sister, Margaret Calder Hayes, was instrumental in the development of the UC Berkeley Art Museum.[4] Four-year-old Calder posed nude for his father's sculpture The Man Cub, a cast of which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In 1902 he also completed his earliest sculpture, a clay elephant.[5] In 1905 his father contracted tuberculosis, and Calder's parents moved to a ranch in Oracle, Arizona, leaving the children in the care of family friends for a year.[6] The children were reunited with their parents in March 1906 and stayed at the Arizona ranch during that summer.[7] The Calder family moved from Arizona to Pasadena, California. The windowed cellar of the family home became Calder's first studio and he received his first set of tools. He used scraps of copper wire to make jewelry for his sister's dolls. On January 1, 1907, Nanette Calder took her son to the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, where he observed a four-horse-chariot race. This style of event later became the finale of Calder's miniature circus performances.[8] In late 1909 the family returned to Philadelphia, where Calder briefly attended Germantown Academy, then they moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York.[9] That Christmas, he sculpted a dog and a duck out of sheet brass as gifts for his parents. The sculptures are three-dimensional and the duck is kinetic because it rocks when gently tapped.[10] In Croton, during his high school years, Calder was befriended by his father's painter friend Everett Shinn with whom he built a gravity-powered system of mechanical trains. Calder described it, \"We ran the train on wooden rails held by spikes; a chunk of iron racing down the incline speeded the cars. We even lit up some cars with candle lights\".[11] After Croton, the Calders moved to Spuyten Duyvil to be closer to New York City, where Stirling Calder rented a studio. While living in Spuyten Duyvil, Calder attended high school in nearby Yonkers. In 1912, Calder's father was appointed acting chief of the Department of Sculpture of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California,[12] and began work on sculptures for the exposition that was held in 1915. During Calder's high school years (1912–1915), the family moved back and forth between New York and California. In each new location, Calder's parents reserved cellar space as a studio for their son. Near the end of this period, Calder stayed with friends in California while his parents moved back to New York, so that he could graduate from Lowell High School in San Francisco.[13]  Calder graduated with the class of 1915.[citation needed] Life and career[edit] Alexander Calder's parents did not want him to be an artist, so he decided to study mechanical engineering. An intuitive engineer since childhood, Calder did not even know what mechanical engineering was. \"I was not very sure what this term meant, but I thought I'd better adopt it,\" he later wrote. He enrolled at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1915.[14] When asked why he decided to study mechanical engineering instead of art Calder said, \"I wanted to be an engineer because some guy I rather liked was a mechanical engineer, that's all\".[15] At Stevens, Calder was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and excelled in mathematics.[16] He was well-liked and the class yearbook contained the following description, \"Sandy is evidently always happy, or perhaps up to some joke, for his face is always wrapped up in that same mischievous, juvenile grin. This is certainly the index to the man's character in this case, for he is one of the best natured fellows there is.\"[15] In the summer of 1916, Calder spent five weeks training at the Plattsburg Civilian Military Training Camp. In 1918, he joined the Student's Army Training Corps, Naval Section, at Stevens and was made guide of the battalion.[17] Calder received a degree from Stevens in 1919.[14] He held a variety of jobs including hydraulic engineer and draughtsman for the New York Edison Company. In June 1922, Calder took a mechanic position on the passenger ship H. F. Alexander. While sailing from San Francisco to New York City, Calder slept on deck and awoke one early morning off the Guatemalan Coast and witnessed both the sun rising and the full moon setting on opposite horizons. He described in his autobiography, \"It was early one morning on a calm sea, off Guatemala, when over my couch—a coil of rope—I saw the beginning of a fiery red sunrise on one side and the moon looking like a silver coin on the other.\"[18] The H.F. Alexander docked in San Francisco and Calder traveled to Aberdeen, Washington, where his sister and her husband, Kenneth Hayes resided. Calder took a job as a timekeeper at a logging camp. The mountain scenery inspired him to write home to request paints and brushes. Shortly after this, Calder decided to move back to New York to pursue a career as an artist. Red Mobile , 1956, Painted sheet metal and metal rods, a signature work by Calder – Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.\nIn New York City, Calder enrolled at the Art Students League, studying briefly with George Luks, Boardman Robinson, and John Sloan.[19] While a student, he worked for the National Police Gazette where, in 1925, one of his assignments was sketching the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Calder became fascinated with the circus action, a theme that would reappear in his later work. In 1926, Calder moved to Paris, enrolled in the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, and established a studio at 22 rue Daguerre in the Montparnasse Quarter. In June 1929, while traveling by boat from Paris to New York, Calder met his future wife, Louisa James (1905–1996), grandniece of author Henry James and philosopher William James. They married in 1931. While in Paris, Calder befriended a number of avant-garde artists, including Fernand Léger, Jean Arp, and Marcel Duchamp. Leger wrote a preface for the catalogue of Calder's first exhibition of abstract constructions held at the Galerie Percier in 1931.[20] Calder and Louisa returned to America in 1933 to a farmhouse they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut, where they raised a family (Sandra born 1935, Mary born 1939). During World War II, Calder attempted to join the Marines as a camofleur, but was rejected. In 1955 he and Louisa traveled through India for three months, where Calder produced nine sculptures as well as some jewelry.[21] In 1963, Calder settled into a new workshop, overlooking the valley of the Lower Chevrière to Saché in Indre-et-Loire (France). He donated to the town a sculpture, which since 1974 has been situated in the town square. Throughout his artistic career, Calder named many of his works in French, regardless of where they were destined for eventual display. In 1966, Calder published his Autobiography with Pictures with the help of his son-in-law, Jean Davidson. Calder died unexpectedly in November 1976 of a heart attack,[22] shortly after the opening of a major retrospective show at the Whitney Museum in New York. Artistic work[edit] Sculpture[edit] Hi! (Two Acrobats) by Alexander Calder, c. 1928, brass wire and wood, Honolulu Museum of Art.\nIn Paris in 1926, Calder began to create his Cirque Calder, a miniature circus fashioned from wire, cloth, string, rubber, cork, and other found objects. Designed to be transportable (it grew to fill five large suitcases), the circus was presented on both sides of the Atlantic. Soon, his Cirque Calder[23] (on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art at present) became popular with the Parisian avant-garde. He also invented wire sculpture, or \"drawing in space\", and in 1929 had his first solo show of these sculptures in Paris at Galerie Billiet. Hi!, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is an early example of the artist's wire sculpture. The painter Jules Pascin, a friend from the cafes of Montparnasse, wrote the preface to the catalog. A visit to Piet Mondrian's studio in 1930, where he was impressed by the environment-as-installation, \"shocked\" him into fully embracing abstract art, toward which he had already been tending.[24] Homage to Jerusalem on Mount Herzl , Jerusalem , Israel.\nIt was the mixture of his experiments to develop purely abstract sculpture following his visit with Mondrian that led to his first truly kinetic sculptures, actuated by motors, that would become his signature artworks. Calder's kinetic sculptures are regarded as being amongst the earliest manifestations of an art that consciously departed from the traditional notion of the art work as a static object and integrated the ideas of gesture and immateriality as aesthetic factors.[25] Dating from 1931, Calder's abstract sculptures of discrete movable parts powered by motors were christened \"mobiles\" by Marcel Duchamp, a French pun meaning both \"motion\" and \"motive\".[26] However, Calder found that the motorized works sometimes became monotonous in their prescribed movements. His solution, arrived at by 1932, was hanging sculptures that derived their motion from touch or air currents. The earliest of these were made of wire, found objects, and wood, a material that Calder used since the 1920s. The hanging mobiles were followed in 1934 by outdoor standing mobiles in industrial materials, which were set in motion by the open air.[27] The wind mobiles featured abstract shapes delicately balanced on pivoting rods that moved with the slightest current of air, allowing for a natural shifting play of forms and spatial relationships.[28] Calder was also experimenting with self-supporting, static, abstract sculptures, dubbed \"stabiles\" by Jean Arp in 1932 to differentiate them from mobiles. At Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937), the Spanish pavilion included Calder's sculpture Mercury Fountain. During World War II, Calder continued to sculpt, adapting to a scarcity of aluminum during the war by returning to carved wood in a new open form of sculpture called \"constellations\".[29] Postwar, Calder began to cut shapes from sheet metal into evocative forms and hand-paint them in his characteristically bold hues.[30] Calder created a small group of works from around this period with a hanging base-plate, for example Lily of Force (1945), Baby Flat Top (1946), and Red is Dominant (1947). He also made works such as Seven Horizontal Discs (1946), which, like Lily of Force (1945) and Baby Flat Top (1946), he was able to dismantle and send by mail for his upcoming show at Galerie Louis Carré in Paris, despite the stringent size restrictions imposed by the postal service at the time.[31] His 1946 show at Carré, which was organized by Duchamp, was composed mainly of hanging and standing mobiles, and it made a huge impact, as did the essay for the catalogue by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.[32] In 1951, Calder devised a new kind of sculpture, related structurally to his constellations. These \"towers\", affixed to the wall with a nail, consist of wire struts and beams that jut from the wall, with moving objects suspended from their armatures.[33] While not denying Calder's power as a sculptor, an alternate view of the history of twentieth-century art[34] cites Calder's turning away in the early 1930s from his motor-powered works in favor of the wind-driven mobile as marking a decisive moment in Modernism's abandonment of its earlier commitment to the machine as a critical and potentially expressive new element in human affairs. According to this viewpoint, the mobile also marked an abandonment of Modernism's larger goal of a rapprochement with science and engineering, and with unfortunate long-term implications for contemporary art. Monumental sculptures[edit] Trois disques , a sculpture by Alexander Calder for Expo 67 , on Saint Helen's Island Parc Jean-Drapeau , Montreal , Quebec, Canada.\nIn 1934, Calder made his first outdoor works in his Roxbury, Connecticut studio, using the same techniques and materials as his smaller works. Exhibited outside, Calder's initial standing mobiles moved elegantly in the breeze, bobbing and swirling in natural, spontaneous rhythms. The first few outdoor works were too delicate for strong winds, which forced Calder to rethink his fabrication process. By 1936 he changed his working methods and began to create smaller-scale maquettes that he then enlarged to monumental size. The small maquette, the first step in the production of a monumental sculpture, was considered by Calder a sculpture in its own right. Larger works used the classic enlargement techniques of traditional sculptors, including his father and grandfather. Drawing his designs on craft paper, he enlarged them using a grid. His large-scale works were created according to his exact specifications, while also allowing him the liberty to adjust or correct a shape or line if necessary.[35] In the 1950s, Calder concentrated more on producing monumental sculptures (his agrandissements period), and public commissions increasingly came his way in the 1960s.[36] Notable examples are .125 (1957) for JFK Airport in New York, Spirale (1958) for UNESCO in Paris, and Trois disques, commissioned for Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Calder's largest sculpture, at 25.7 meters high, was El Sol Rojo, constructed outside the Estadio Azteca for the 1968 Summer Olympics \"Cultural Olympiad\" events in Mexico City. Many of his public artworks were commissioned by renowned architects; for example, I.M. Pei commissioned La Grande Voile, a 25-ton, 40-foot high stabile sculpture for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966. Calder's La Grande Vitesse (1969), Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nMost of Calder's monumental stationery and mobile sculptures were made after 1962 at Etablissements Biémont in Tours, France. He would create a model of his work, the engineering department would scale it up under Calder's direction, and technicians would complete the actual metalwork — all under Calder's watchful eye. Stabiles were made in steel plate, then painted. An exception was Trois disques, in stainless steel at 24 meters tall, commissioned by International Nickel Company of Canada. In 1958, Calder asked Jean Prouvé to construct the steel base of Spirale in France, a monumental mobile for the UNESCO site in Paris, while the top was fabricated in Connecticut. In June 1969, Calder attended the dedication of his monumental \"stabile\" sculpture La Grande Vitesse in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This sculpture is notable for being the first civic sculpture in the United States to receive funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.[37] In 1971, Calder created his Bent Propeller which was installed at the entrance of the World Trade Center's North Tower in New York City. When Battery Park City opened, the sculpture was moved to Vesey and Church Streets.[38] The sculpture stood in front of 7 World Trade Center until it was destroyed on September 11, 2001.[39]\nIn 1973, the 63-foot tall vermillion-colored public art sculpture Four Arches was installed on Bunker Hill, Los Angeles to serve as \"a distinctive landmark.\"[40] The plaza site was designed in tiers to maximize the sculpture's visual effects.[41] In 1974, Calder unveiled two sculptures, Flamingo at Federal Plaza, and Universe at Sears Tower,[42] in Chicago, Illinois, accompanied by the exhibition Alexander Calder: A Retrospective Exhibition, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago which opened simultaneously with the unveiling of the sculptures.[43] Originally meant to be constructed in 1977 for the Hart Senate Office Building, Mountains and Clouds was not built until 1985 due to government budget cuts. The massive sheet-metal project, weighing 35 tons, spans the nine-story height of the building's atrium in Washington, D.C. Calder designed the maquette for the United States Senate in the last year of his life.[44] Theatrical productions[edit] Calder created stage sets for more than a dozen theatrical productions, including Nucléa, Horizon, and most notably, Martha Graham's Panorama (1935), a production of the Erik Satie symphonic drama Socrate (1936), and later, Works in Progress (1968). Works in Progress was a \"ballet\" conceived by Calder himself and produced at the Rome Opera House, featuring an array of mobiles, stabiles, and large painted backdrops. Calder would describe some of his stage sets as dancers performing a choreography due to their rhythmic movement.[45] Painting and printmaking[edit] In addition to sculptures, Calder painted throughout his career, beginning in the early 1920s. He picked up his study of printmaking in 1925, and continued to produce illustrations for books and journals.[46] His projects from this period include pen-and-ink line drawings of animals for a 1931 publication of Aesop's fables. As Calder's sculpture moved into the realm of pure abstraction in the early 1930s, so did his prints. The thin lines used to define figures in the earlier prints and drawings began delineating groups of geometric shapes, often in motion. Calder also used prints for advocacy, as in poster prints from 1967 and 1969 protesting the Vietnam War.[47] As Calder's professional reputation expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s, so did his production of prints. Masses of lithographs based on his gouache paintings were marketed, and deluxe editions of plays, poems, and short stories illustrated with fine art prints by Calder became available.[46] Painted aircraft and automobile[edit] Calder's South American-themed design applied to a Braniff Douglas DC-8-62 taken at Miami Airport in 1975.\nOne of Calder's more unusual undertakings was a commission from Dallas-based Braniff International Airways to paint a full-size Douglas DC-8-62 four-engined jet as a \"flying canvas\". George Stanley Gordon, founder of the New York City advertising agency Gordon and Shortt, approached Calder with the idea of painting a jet in 1972, but Calder responded that he did not paint toys. When Gordon told him it was a real, full-sized airliner he was proposing, the artist immediately gave his approval. Gordon felt that Braniff, known for melding the worlds of fashion and design with the world of aviation, would be the perfect company to carry out the idea. Braniff Chairman Harding Lawrence was highly receptive and a contract was drawn up in 1973 calling for the painting of one Douglas DC-8-62 jet liner, dubbed Flying Colors, and 50 gouaches for a total price of $100,000.[48] Two years later, Braniff asked Calder to design a flagship for their fleet celebrating the U.S. Bicentennial. That piece, a Boeing 727-291 jet N408BN called the Flying Colors of the United States, and nicknamed the 'Sneaky Snake' by its pilots (based on quirky flight tendencies), featured a rippled image of red, white and blue echoing a waving American flag.[14] A third design, to be dubbed Salute to Mexico, was commissioned but went uncompleted following his death.[49] 1975 BMW 3.0 CSL painted by Calder.\nIn 1975 Calder was commissioned to paint a BMW 3.0 CSL automobile, which would be the first vehicle in the BMW Art Car Project.[50] Jewelry[edit] Calder created over 2,000 pieces of jewelry over the course of his career, many as gifts for friends. Several pieces reflect his fascination with art from Africa and other continents.[51] They were mostly made of brass and steel, with bits of ceramic, wood and glass. Calder rarely used solder; when he needed to join strips of metal, he linked them with loops, bound them with snippets of wire or fashioned rivets.[52] Calder created his first pieces in 1906 at the age of eight for his sister's dolls using copper wire that he found in the street.[51] For his lifelong friend Joan Miró, Calder set a shard of a broken porcelain vessel in a brass ring. Peggy Guggenheim received enormous silver mobile earrings and later commissioned a hammered silver headboard that shimmered with dangling fish.[53] In 1942, Guggenheim wore one Calder earring and one by Yves Tanguy to the opening of her New York gallery, The Art of This Century, to demonstrate her equal loyalty to Surrealist and abstract art, examples of which she displayed in separate galleries.[54] Others who were presented with Calder's pieces were the artist's close friend, Georgia O'Keeffe; Teeny Duchamp, wife of Marcel Duchamp; Jeanne Rucar, wife of the filmmaker Luis Buñuel; and Bella Rosenfeld, wife of Marc Chagall.[55] Exhibitions[edit] Calder room at National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Calder's first solo exhibition was in 1927 at the Gallery of Jacques Seligmann in Paris.[56] His first solo show in a US commercial gallery was in 1928 at the Weyhe Gallery in New York City. He exhibited with the Abstraction-Création group in Paris in 1933. In 1935, he had his first solo museum exhibition in the United States at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago. In New York, he was championed from the early 1930s by the Museum of Modern Art, and was one of three Americans to be included in Alfred H. Barr Jr.'s 1936 exhibition Cubism and Abstract Art.[57] Calder's first retrospective was held in 1938 at George Walter Vincent Smith Gallery in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1943, the Museum of Modern Art hosted a Calder retrospective, curated by James Johnson Sweeney and Marcel Duchamp; the show had to be extended due to the number of visitors.[31] Calder was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949. His mobile, International Mobile was the centerpiece of the exhibition. Calder also participated in documentas I (1955), II (1959), III (1964). Major retrospectives of his work were held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1964), the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France (1969), and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1974). In addition, both of Calder's dealers, Galerie Maeght in Paris and the Perls Galleries in New York, averaged about one Calder show each per year. Collections[edit] Calder's work is in many permanent collections across the world. The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, has the largest body of work by Alexander Calder.[58] Other museum collections include the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid; and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.[59] There are two pieces on display in the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY.[60] The Philadelphia Museum of Art offers a view of works by three generations of Alexander Calders. From the second floor window on the east side of the Great Stair Hall (on the opposite side from the armor collection) there is behind the viewer the Ghost mobile from the 3rd generation (born 1898),[61] ahead on the street is the Swann Memorial Fountain by the 2nd generation (born 1870), and beyond that the statue of William Penn atop City Hall from the 1st generation (born 1846).

A copy of a Pierre Matisse sales ledger in the foundation's files shows that only a few pieces in the 1941 show found buyers, one of whom, Solomon R. Guggenheim, paid only $233.34 (equivalent to $4,106 in 2020) for a work. The Museum of Modern Art had bought its first Calder in 1934 for $60, after talking Calder down from $100.[29] And yet by 1948 Calder nearly sold out an entire solo show in Rio de Janeiro, becoming the first internationally renowned sculptor.[64] Galerie Maeght in Paris became Calder's exclusive Parisian dealer in 1950 and for the rest of Calder's life. After his New York dealer Curt Valentin died unexpectedly in 1954, Calder selected the Perls Galleries in New York as his new American dealer, and this alliance lasted until Calder's death.[65] In 2010, his metal mobile Untitled (Autumn Leaves), sold at Sotheby's New York for $3.7 million. Another mobile brought $6.35 million at Christie's later that year.[66] Also at Christie's, a standing mobile called Lily of Force (1945), which was expected to sell for $8 to $12 million, was bought for $18.5 million in 2012.[67] Calder's 7.5-foot-long hanging mobile Poisson volant (Flying Fish) (1957) fetched $25.9 million, setting an auction record for the sculptor at Christie's New York in 2014.[68][69] Legacy[edit] Eagle (1971). Olympic Sculpture Park , Seattle , Washington.\nBeginning in 1966, winners of the National Magazine Awards are awarded an \"Ellie\", a copper-colored stabile resembling an elephant, which was designed by Calder. Two months after his death, the artist was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian honor, by President Gerald Ford. However, representatives of the Calder family boycotted the January 10, 1977, ceremony \"to make a statement favoring amnesty for Vietnam War draft resisters\". Calder Foundation[edit] In 1987, the Calder Foundation was established by Calder's family, \"dedicated to collecting, exhibiting, preserving, and interpreting the art and archives of Alexander Calder and [is] charged with an unmatched collection of his works\".[70] The foundation has large holdings, with some works owned by family members and others by foundation supporters. The art includes more than 600 sculptures including mobiles, stabiles, standing mobiles, and wire sculptures, and 22 monumental outdoor works, as well as thousands of oil paintings, works on paper, toys, pieces of jewelry, and domestic objects.[71]\nAfter having worked mainly on cataloging Calder's works, the Calder Foundation is now focusing on organizing global exhibitions for the artist.[72] One of Calder's grandsons, Alexander S. C. \"Sandy\" Rower, is the president of the foundation and other family members are on the board of trustees.[73] Authenticity issues[edit] The Calder Foundation does not authenticate artworks; rather, owners can submit their works for registration in the Foundation's archive and for examination.[74] The committee that performs examinations includes experts, scholars, museum curators, and members of the Calder family.[75] The Calder Foundation's website provides details on the current policies and guidelines governing examination procedures.[76] In 1993, the owners of Rio Nero (1959), a sheet-metal and steel-wire mobile ostensibly by Calder, went to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging that it was not by Alexander Calder, as claimed by its seller.[77] That same year, a federal judge ruled that for Rio Nero the burden of proof had not been fulfilled.[further explanation needed] Despite the decision, the owners of the mobile could not sell it because the recognized expert, Klaus Perls, had declared it a copy. The judge recognized the problem at the time, noting that Perls' pronouncement would make Rio Nero unsellable. In 1994, the Calder Foundation declined to include the mobile in the catalogue raisonné on the artist.[78] Referring to the Rio Nero case, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court in 2009 rejected the appeal of an art collector who wished to sell a couple of stage sets that Calder had designed but did not live to see completed, which had been unsuccessfully submitted to the Calder Foundation for authentication.[79] The court found that it did not have the power to declare the purported Calder work authentic, nor to order the Calder Foundation to include it in the catalogue raisonné. In 1995, questions arose about another purported Calder, Two White Dots (not to be confused with the similarly named piece, Two White Dots in the Air, which Calder created in 1958).  In 1973, Calder had created a 1-foot (0.30 m)-high sheet metal maquette for an unrealized stabile he called Two White Dots. He gave this maquette to Carmen Segretario, founder and owner of the Segré Foundry of Waterbury, Connecticut. For decades, Calder had utilized the services of Segré Foundry in manufacturing his mobiles and stabiles. Each piece (no matter how many copies were made) would be initialed personally by Calder in white chalk, after which a welder would follow the chalk marks to burn the initials into the work. Calder died in 1976, without a full-size version of Two White Dots having been made. In 1982, Segretario constructed a full-size version of Two White Dots, and sold it in 1983 to art dealer Shirley Teplitz for $70,000. Segetario's documentation claimed that the work had been fabricated around 1974 \"under the supervision and direction of Artist\".[80] Two White Dots was then sold at auction in May 1984 for $187,000.[81] Over the next decade, the piece was sold repeatedly. In 1995, Jon Shirley (the former president of Microsoft and a Calder collector) purchased Two White Dots for $1 million. When Shirley submitted the work to the Calder Foundation for inclusion in their catalogue raisonné, the Foundation contested the work's authenticity. The André Emmerich Gallery refunded Shirley's money, and sued the Segré Foundry, which sought bankruptcy protection. The suit was settled out of court in the late 1990s. Two White Dots now resides outdoors on a farm near a river outside the small town of Washington, Connecticut.[80] In 2013 the Calder Estate filed a lawsuit against the estate of his former dealer, Klaus Perls, alleging that Perls had sold fake Calders as well as concealing the ownership of 679 works by the artist.[82] After a high-profile battle with much press coverage, the lawsuit was dismissed by judge Judge Shirley Werner Kornreich in the New York State Supreme Court.[83] Personal life[edit] Calder and his wife, Louisa, were the parents of two daughters, Sandra (born 1935) and Mary (1939-2011).[84][85] Mary's husband, Howard Rower (1939-2000), had been chairman of the board of the Alexander and Louisa Calder Foundation.[86] Mary and Howard's two sons are Alexander S. C. \"Sandy\" Rower (1963), president of the Calder Foundation,[87] and Holton Rower (1962), a vice president of the Foundation.[73] Alexander Rower established the Foundation in 1987 with the support of the Calder family. He has four children, including Gryphon Rower-Upjohn, a sound experimentalist, composer-performer, and curator in the field of audiovisual culture, who is also known as Gryphon Rue.[88][89] Sandra Calder Davidson and her late husband, Jean Davidson, have a son, Shawn (1956), and a daughter, Andréa (1961).[90] Sandra, Shawn and Andréa are vice presidents of the Calder Foundation.[73] Jean Davidson was the son of artist Jo Davidson. Sandra is an illustrator of children's books. She caricatured her family and friends as animals in the 2013 book The Calder Family and Other Critters: Portraits and Reflections.[91] The Calder family has a long-standing connection with the Putney School, a progressive co-ed boarding school in Vermont. Calder's daughters attended the school as did several of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.[92][93] Around 2007, the Rower family donated a standing mobile (a mobile that stands on its own fixed base) to Putney. A 13-foot mobile hangs in Calder Hall in the Michael S. Currier Center on campus.[89] Gallery[edit] L'empennage (1953), Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art Acoustic Ceiling (1953),\nAula Magna, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela La Ciudad (1960), Galería de Arte Nacional, Caracas - Venezuela The Four Elements (1961), Moderna Museet, installation at the museum entrance Le tamanoir (The Anteater) (1963),\nRotterdam, Netherlands Têtes et queue (Heads and tail) (1965),\nBerlin, Germany De tre vingarna (The Three Wings) (1967), Blå Stället, Angered, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Alexander Calder 1898, Lawnton, US — 1976, New York, US.\nShare Alexander Calder was born July 22, 1898, in Lawnton, Pennsylvania. In 1919, he received an engineering degree from Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken. Calder attended the Art Students League, New York, from 1923 to 1925, studying briefly with Boardman Robinson and John Sloan. As a freelance artist for the National Police Gazette in 1925, he spent two weeks sketching at the circus; his fascination with the subject dates from this time. He also made his first wire sculpture in 1925; the following year he made several constructions of animals and figures with wire and wood. Calder’s first exhibition of paintings took place in 1926 at the Artist’s Gallery, New York. Later that year, he went to Paris and attended the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. In Paris, he met Stanley William Hayter, exhibited at the 1926 Salon des Indépendants, and began giving performances of his miniature circus. The first show of his wire animals and caricature portraits was held at the Weyhe Gallery, New York, in 1928. That same year, he met Joan Miró, who became his lifelong friend. Subsequently, Calder divided his time between France and the United States. In 1929, the Galerie Billiet gave him his first solo show in Paris. He met Frederick Kiesler, Fernand Léger, and Theo van Doesburg and visited Piet Mondrian’s studio in 1930. Calder began to experiment with abstract sculpture at this time and in 1931 and 1932 introduced moving parts into his work. These moving sculptures were called “mobiles”; the stationary constructions were to be named “stabiles.” He exhibited with the Abstraction-Création group in Paris in 1933. In 1943, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, gave him a retrospective. During the 1950s, Calder traveled widely and executed Towers (wall mobiles) and Gongs (sound mobiles). He won the Grand Prize for Sculpture at the 1952 Venice Biennale. Late in the decade, the artist worked extensively with gouache; from this period, he executed numerous major public commissions. In 1964–65, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, presented a Calder retrospective. He began the Totems in 1966 and the Animobiles in 1971; both are variations on the standing mobile. A Calder exhibition was held at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, in 1976.

{"id": 130, "data": "Skip to main content Neue Nationalgalerie with Têtes et queue (1965) by Alexander Calder, 1993. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Nationalgalerie. © 2021 Calder Foundation, New York / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York. Photo by Reinhard Friedrich Alexander Calder. Minimal / Maximal 22.08.2021 – 13.02.2022.\nSince the opening of the Neue Nationalgalerie in 1968, Alexander Calder’s “Têtes et queue” (1965) has stood on the sculpture terrace as a landmark of the building. In the course of the museum’s renovation, the sculpture was also restored – a perfect opportunity for an exhibition on one of the most famous American sculptors of the 20th century.\n No place could be more suitable than Mies van der Rohe’s open hall, his great architectural legacy. Calder and Mies were not only contemporaries; in both cases, spatial experience is also a central concern: Mies abandoned tightly enclosed architecture and worked with open structures; Calder detached sculpture from its fixed references to the floor or plinth and tied it closely to audience interaction. The focus of the exhibition “Alexander Calder. Minimal / Maximal” lies on Calder’s spectacular shifts in scale. His sculptures range from filigree miniatures to monumental stabiles, mobiles, and standing mobiles. The presentation traces this special relationship between size, scale and space, which unfolds a unique effect in Mies van der Rohe’s glass steel construction.\n It is not about a simple juxtaposition of small and large or mobile and fixed, but about the ever-varying spatial experiences created by walking around and interacting with the works. The show concentrates on sculptures from the later decades of the artist’s career. In the mid-1950s, technical progress in steel production had opened up new perspectives for the sculptor, both artistically and in terms of dimensions. Thanks to the modernity of the material and the moving elements, the objects from this period present themselves majestically and clearly, but at the same time often in an urban setting. Outstanding examples of this are sculptures such as “Les Trois Ailes” and “Les Triangles” (both 1963) as well as the bright red monumental stabile “Five Swords” (1976), whose expressively reaching sabre-like arms appear different from every angle. The sculpture can only be grasped in its complexity by walking around it, looking at it both up close and from a distance, and experiencing its dynamics within the surrounding spaces.\n Alexander Calder’s stabile Five Swords at the Neue Nationalgalerie, Five Swords, 1976, sheet metal, bolts and paint © 2021 Calder Foundation, New York / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.

Photo by Tom Powel Imaging A considerable change in scale can also be seen in Calder’s mobiles after 1950. Significant works such as “Blizzard” (1950) or “Otto’s Mobile” (1952) can be seen in the exhibition, which, with their movable elements and their partly horizontal, partly vertical orientation, change the surrounding spaces almost imperceptibly yet constantly. This transformation is also found in Calder’s small objects, which take up the forms and constellations of his large sculptures. The majority of the miniatures in this exhibition standing mobiles, which balance movable wire constructions on a metal base. Calder’s miniatures are often several things at once: models for larger sculptures, artistic experiments, and independent works, all of which demonstrate that a potentially enormous object that could also have been enormous loses nothing in expressiveness in a small format. Indeed, the miniatures demand attention and concentration. Instead of a public spectacle, they can only be experienced in an almost private presentation. Making this intimacy possible was a central starting point of the exhibition. At scheduled times, some of the objects will also be presented and activated outside the protective showcases.\n Time and again, Calder made objects that invite engagement, be it through experiencing their shifting perspectives or “using” them, like the chess sets he produced in the 1940s. In the exhibition, there will be the opportunity to play with facsimiles of a 1944 chess set developed by Calder – just as intended at the time it was made. For Calder’s works – regardless of whether they are monumental or miniature – the surrounding space functions as a stage on which a visual as well as physical connection with the audience takes place. Scale, size, and proportion, along with colour, contrast, and the diversity of form and movement, are central tools for Calder – and the key to his definition of sculpture as a “social” object. It is perhaps Calder’s greatest challenge that we approach his work intuitively, interact with it, perceive it in its complexity, and understand it together with its surroundings as a space of experience. And it is precisely in this experiential space that the Neue Nationalgalerie gives a special, distinctive stage.\n Alexander Calder’s chess set in blue and red.

ISBN 978-3-7913-7929-6 The work of the US artist Alexander Calder (1898-1976) is characterised by a change of scale. His objects range from filigree, tiny objects to large stabiles and mobiles that reach far into space. The compilation of works on display traces this special relationship between size, scale and space in Calder’s sculptures, which unfold their unique effect in and in front of the Neue Nationalgalerie, Mies van der Rohe’s glass steel construction. The exhibition and book strive for an open, experimental engagement with the sculptor’s oeuvre; they take a particular look at the specific spatial experiences associated with the works. Social interaction and participation are therefore central themes of the book. Richly illustrated short texts, for example on the mobiles, the chess games conceived by Calder or his relationship to architecture, complement the book.

{"id": 134, "data": "Skip to content The American sculptor Alexander Calder (1898-1976) revolutionized the medium of sculpture in the 20th century, first with his development of the new medium of wire sculptures to create spontaneous \"drawings in space,\" and then with his delicate, kinetic sculptures known as \"mobiles,\" which pioneered the introduction of motion into the formerly static medium. Born into an artistic family—his father and grandfather were both well-known sculptors and his mother was a portrait painter—Calder was encouraged to create as a child. From the age of eight, he had his own workshop in his family’s home, where he made small sculptures and objects. Despite his early talent for artistic creation, Calder decided to study mechanical engineering and received his degree in 1919 from the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. After four years of shifting between various engineering and other jobs, Calder decided to become an artist and enrolled at the Art Students League in New York. While in New York, Calder worked as a freelance illustrator for the National Police Gazette, sketching sporting events and circus scenes for the publication. He soon left New York for Paris, then the center of the avant-garde, and shortly after arriving in July 1926, he began work on his first great work of kinetic art, his miniature Cirque Calder, fashioning the components from wire and other found materials. By manipulating his tiny sculptures of figures, animals, and circus apparatus, Calder brought his circus to life in animated performances which were experienced by prominent avant-garde artists such as Fernand Léger, Joan Miró, Piet Mondrian, and Le Corbusier. Between 1926 and 1931, Calder developed more elaborate acts and elements for his circus, eventually requiring five suitcases to move the portable work of art. During this time, Calder also began making wire sculptures, pioneering a new genre of sculpture in a medium without precedent. Like three-dimensional line drawings, his wire sculptures depicted animals, fellow artists and friends, and portraits of famous figures of the day. Carrying wire and pliers with him, Calder liked to spontaneously “draw in space” with his preferred medium. Calder shifted towards making more geometric and abstract work after visiting Mondrian at his studio in Paris in 1930, abandoning his figurative wire sculptures for pure abstraction. Drawing upon his engineering background, Calder made his first moving sculptures, which were either hand-cranked or powered by rudimentary motors. These works introduced motion into the static medium of sculpture, revolutionizing the medium. Marcel Duchamp christened Calder’s abstract, kinetic sculptures as “mobiles” when he saw one of the motorized sculptures in 1931. In French, “mobile” connotes both “moveable” and “motive”; Calder liked the double entendre of the word and adopted it for his kinetic constructions. In addition to the mobiles, Calder also began creating stationary sculptures comprised of large sheets of metal that were placed on the ground, named “stabiles” by the sculptor Jean Arp. As Calder later explained the two types of sculpture, “the mobile has actual movement in itself, while the stabile is back at the old painting idea of implied movement. You have to walk around a stabile or through it—a mobile dances in front of you.” Shortly after his first mobiles, Calder began to develop complex constructions that relied upon weights and balances, rather than machines or cranks, for their motion. Using lightweight materials—such as wire, metal, wood, string, and other elements-- these mobiles are so delicate that they are propelled into motion by subtle wind and air currents. Whether standing or hanging, these mobiles come to life on their own, with their suspended forms sweeping, turning, or rotating in graceful movements, dynamically arranging and rearranging their forms in space. Calder preferred the less predictable, spontaneous motion of these mobiles and soon abandoned his mechanically activated constructions. In 1933, Calder and his wife Louisa returned to the United States, moving into an old farmhouse in Roxbury, Connecticut. In the 1930s, he began experimenting with larger sculptures, creating commissions for the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 World Fair and a hanging mobile for the main stairwell of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. During World War II, Calder turned to wood as a new medium for his work, as metal was in short supply due to the war effort. Combining carved wood elements with wire, these new sculptures were named the “constellations” by Duchamp and the curator James Johnson Sweeney when they were exhibited at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in 1943. Calder continued to make and widely exhibit both small-scale and large mobiles and stabiles throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and increasingly turned to making monumental outdoor sculptures in his later years, many of which were commissioned as public works in the 1950s through the 1970s.\n Around Color New York July 12 - August 18, 2021.\nImpressionist, Modern, and Postwar Masters Palm Beach April 1 - May 28, 2021.\nThree Dimensions: Modern and Contemporary Approaches to Relief and Sculpture September - November 2017.\nCalder | Miró Constellations April - May 2017.\nMasterworks from Degas to Rosenquist Masterworks from Degas to Rosenquist February - April 2012.\nThe New York Times Miró, Calder and a Convergence of ‘Constellations’ by Arthur Lubow April 20, 2017.\nThe Art Newspaper When the Stars Align: Miró and Calder to shine in joint New York shows December 12, 2016.\nT Magazine Two Men and a Show November 15, 2015.\nView More \n", "label": [[38, 54, "ARTIST"], [56, 65, "DATE"], [113, 125, "DATE"], [502, 508, "ARTIST"], [707, 713, "ARTIST"], [781, 785, "DATE"], [830, 849, "GPE"], [857, 867, "DATE"], [924, 930, "ARTIST"], [1002, 1010, "GPE"], [1021, 1029, "GPE"], [1031, 1037, "ARTIST"], [1183, 1191, "GPE"], [1196, 1201, "GPE"], [1269, 1278, "DATE"], [1348, 1361, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1505, 1511, "ARTIST"], [1628, 1641, "ARTIST"], [1643, 1652, "ARTIST"], [1654, 1667, "ARTIST"], [1673, 1685, "ARTIST"], [1695, 1708, "DATE"], [1710, 1716, "ARTIST"], [1864, 1870, "ARTIST"], [2156, 2162, "ARTIST"], [2229, 2235, "ARTIST"], [2307, 2315, "ARTIST"], [2333, 2338, "GPE"], [2342, 2346, "DATE"], [2453, 2459, "ARTIST"], [2654, 2668, "ARTIST"], [2680, 2686, "ARTIST"], [2778, 2782, "DATE"], [2843, 2849, "ARTIST"], [2962, 2968, "ARTIST"], [3111, 3119, "ARTIST"], [3124, 3130, "ARTIST"], [3405, 3411, "ARTIST"], [3934, 3940, "ARTIST"], [4073, 4077, "DATE"], [4079, 4085, "ARTIST"], [4118, 4135, "GPE"], [4169, 4189, "GPE"], [4198, 4203, "DATE"], [4305, 4309, "DATE"], [4310, 4320, "EVENT"], [4372, 4392, "MUSEUM"], [4396, 4404, "GPE"], [4413, 4425, "EVENT"], [4427, 4433, "ARTIST"], [4629, 4636, "ARTIST"], [4653, 4674, "CURATOR"], [4707, 4729, "GALLERY"], [4733, 4737, "DATE"], [4739, 4745, "ARTIST"], [4846, 4851, "DATE"], [4856, 4861, "DATE"], [5002, 5007, "DATE"], [5020, 5025, "DATE"], [5028, 5040, "EVENT"], [5041, 5049, "GPE"], [5050, 5075, "DATE"], [5077, 5119, "EVENT"], [5120, 5130, "GPE"], [5131, 5153, "DATE"], [5155, 5231, "EVENT"], [5232, 5257, "DATE"], [5259, 5265, "ARTIST"], [5268, 5287, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5288, 5304, "DATE"], [5306, 5379, "EVENT"], [5380, 5401, "DATE"], [5422, 5426, "ARTIST"], [5428, 5434, "ARTIST"], [5476, 5488, "ARTIST"], [5489, 5503, "DATE"], [5545, 5549, "ARTIST"], [5554, 5560, "ARTIST"], [5579, 5587, "GPE"], [5594, 5611, "DATE"], [5643, 5660, "DATE"]]}
{"id": 136, "data": "Skip to main content December 19, 2015 9:00am Alexander Calder , Triple Gong , ca. 1948, brass, sheet metal, wire, and paint. CALDER FOUNDATION, NEW YORK/ART RESOURCE, NEW YORK/©ARTISTS RIGHTS SOCIETY (ARS), NEW YORK AND DACS, LONDON.\n Alexander Calder (1898–1976), whose career spanned more than half a century, continued to reinvent himself well into the later decades of his life. His work was always about motion, literally and figuratively, as the Tate Modern’s show “Alexander Calder: Performing Sculpture” makes clear—his mobiles spin around, rather than being planted firmly on the ground. Fittingly, Calder became more free as his career went on, and it was exactly this topic that was the subject of an Summer 1973 ARTnews profile, which looked at how, at age 75, Calder was more independent and ambitious than ever. Some things Herbert Mitigang noted in his profile of Calder: the sculptor wore L.L. Bean, he was more politically minded than critics gave him credit for, and he was very friendly. Mitigang’s profile follows in full below. —Alex Greenberger\n“Alexander Calder at 75: adventures of a free man”\nBy Herbert Mitgang On July 22 of this year, Alexander Calder turns 75. The artist would be the last one to say so, but this day is a milestone in the history of American and international sculpture. If I were given the pleasant task of writing a few lines for a Presidential Medal of Freedom for Calder, they might read: “Alexander Calder, son and grandson of American academic sculptors, creator of joy in a circus of wire and wood, inventor of the mobile and stabile, bender of forms for multimedia exhibitions and entertainments in music, ballet and film, illustrator of bales and books, sculptural ambassador to UNESCO and to museums and nations wherever the four winds blow.” But nobody has asked me or anyone else to do so. Sandy Calder is too free a man and artist to need governmental honors.  Genius is not always perceptible in person, especially when hidden behind an L. L. Bean woolen shirt and standing in heavy workingman’s shoes, accompanied by constant laughter and chuckling. Simplicity is often a characteristic of genius, but courtesy not necessarily so, nor the desire for companionship. But Calder will hold the door for you as you enter the quaint old elevator for the short trip to the private quarters in the Perls Gallery in New York. Calder is so devoted to friends, so gregarious, that when he goes from the first to the third floor he wants company for the ride. He asks his dealer and friend, Klaus Perls, for a drink—“the red stuff”—and then hands the Campari to his nearest seatmate. His large body and silver hair dominate the private gallery-living room full of Picassos, Mirós, Braques — and Calders: a small mobile standing on a Noguchi table, a larger, spinning one, a fish with colored glass body, capturing the sunlight of Madison Avenue. At the artist’s side is his wife Louisa (whose father, Edward Holton James, was a nephew of Henry James), wearing a complex necklace designed by her husband. We are talking about art and politics and freedom, and Louisa Calder makes a perceptive comment on the subject: “Truth is political, there is politics in truth, and the absence of truth in an artist’s work is also political.” Calder’s sculptures, seen in a larger perspective, are constantly putting the First Amendment—freedom of expression with abridgment—into the public air. He is laughing at convention and restriction, at established authority and at earthlings in positions of power. Calder does not issue pronunciamentos about indecencies and injustices in the U.S. or elsewhere; he does not have to because his work flouts brutality in men and art. At another gallery down the street are some posters he contributed to help the Democratic candidate in the 1972 election; he made posters for fund-raising parties among expatriates in Paris; he contributed drawings for the benefit of Publishers for Peace; he created sculpture to help the Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War; he marched to protest the Vietnam war. And yet Calder does so not from a political point of view—except insofar as “truth is political”—but as a generous person and artist. “Sandy is a concerned man, from the human point of view,” says his friends and former editor, Fabio Coen. “He is spontaneous, the youngest thinking man I know, and he can be fiery, too. He is earthy, without doubletalk or sham, which is rare.” Alexander Calder in his Roxbury studio, 1941. CALDER FOUNDATION/ART RESOURCE, NEW YORK/©ARTISTS RIGHTS SOCIETY (ARS), NEW YORK AND DACS, LONDON, 2014.\nThe artist’s close friend and neighbour, Robert Osborn, the well-known illustrator and cartoonist, says: “Sandy is direct, uncomplicated and simple. He says very little at times when he is in the center of things because of his taste and modesty, but his remarks at the luncheon table are funny and always to the point. The logic of the mind behind that imagination is a joy to behold.” Osborn recalls the time they went to Washington together with their wives for a demonstration against the brutality of the war in Indochina. They were with the Connecticut delegation. “We shuffled along, and one was glad that Louisa and Sandy and John Hersey and Robert Lowell and other good people were there, moral and kind souls. Calder was there to lend his name and his bulky presence against the killing and the folly of war.” In the courtyard of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations there is a Calder called Peace. The sculptor recalled that the installation came about because Arthur Goldberg was the American ambassador to the U.N. at the time. “Apparently I was very nice to Mrs. Goldberg a long time ago when she saw my work at a show in Chicago. She asked me to do something for the United Nations. I wanted to do something for peace. Once night when I was coming home on the train I saw this stabile standing outside Carmen’s ship in Waterbury [where iron-workers assemble his models at the foundry] and decided that it would be appropriate for the U.N., so I gave it to them.” Léger has said about Calder’s sculpture, “It is 100 per cent American.” Of course, but Calder is the most international of American artists. He was first recognized in Europe, and his works now are in museums from Caracas to Lodz and in public or semi-public squares and buildings around the world. His monumental The Spiral was done for UNESCO headquarters in Paris. His Teodelapio in Spoleto, 60 feet high and weighing 30 tons, his first monumental stabile, was assembled by a shipbuilder in Genoa. It arches the Spoleto crossroads, high and erect. “People keep giving it a phallic meaning,” Calder says. “I wasn’t aware of any such influence, but that may give it its nice force.” I mentioned that a friend of mine who lives near Lincoln Center had noticed some graffiti on Calder’s Le Guichet standing in front of the Library for the Performing Arts. “I don’t mind if people touch my work,” he laughed, “but I hope they don’t kick it.” When his work was exhibited at the Guggenheim Museum—one of the rare occasions when works of art overpowered Frank Lloyd Wright’s architecture—visitors instinctively reached out to touch the mobiles. “They’re meant to be touched delicately. I like the whang they make—noise is like another dimension.” When his mobiles fly in the air at the Museum of Modern Art, I find it almost impossible not to test the force of the wind in my lungs and see if I can make them shiver slightly. Somehow it always brings to mind Yeats’ line, “turning and turning in the widening gyre”—except that in Calder’s case the center always holds. His career as an artist began almost casually for Alexander Calder in the Philadelphia suburb of Lawnton, where he was born in the summer of 1898, the son of artists. His father, A. Sterling Calder, a leading academic sculptor, used Sandy at age 4 to pose for a chubby nude, Man Cub, and the lad also sat for his mother, a painter. His grandfather, Alexander Milne Calder, from Scotland, made the statue of William Penn on the dome of Philadelphia’s City Hall. Whether the family lived in Pasadena, Croton-on-Hudson or San Francisco, there was always a studio to ramble in. In New York, when the Calders moved to Claremont Avenue, near Barnard College, Sandy would go downtown to visit his father’s sculpture shop in an old movie studio on East 14th Street. There was always a little corner set aside for Sandy to work with tools, making toys and helmets. It was the mechanical rather than the artistic aspects of the family studio that first interested him. He was fascinated, for example, by the pointing machine for enlarging small sculptures. He crossed the Hudson and began studying at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, which turned out to be a stroke of luck; it gave him a strong base of mechanical engineering for his later sculptures. After earning his degree he intended to make a career as an engineer. He worked for an automotive engineer in New Jersey, left to become a draftsman for the New York Edison Company, briefly took a job with a hydraulics firm, held down an efficiency expert’s job at Abraham & Straus. He worked as a demonstrator for a company selling motorized garden cultivators, signed on as a fireman on a steamship going to San Francisco, caught a lumber schooner heading for Washington State, became a timekeeper in a logging camp, and for the first time developed his true instinct—he painted scenes of the life around him in the Pacific Northwest. Alexander Calder, Red and Yellow Vane , 1934. CALDER FOUNDATION, NEW YORK/ART RESOURCE, NEW YORK/©ARTISTS RIGHTS SOCIETY, NEW YORK AND DACS, LONDON, 2014.\nAt the age of 25, after knocking around as a lumberman and quasi-engineer, Calder decided to become a painter. “I was getting fed up with all these miscellaneous jobs,” he told his son-on-law, Jean Davidson, for his reminiscences (Calder, Pantheon Books). “I remember the dullest of all, some interim job which consisted in opening cases of applesauce and gluing some label on each can—to pretend the applesauce came from somewhere else.” That did it, and he entered the Art Students League in New York, studying with George Luks, Guy Pène du Bois, John Sloan and Boardman Robinson. Calder connected with Robinson; he learned from him how to draw with a pen and a single line. In 1924 this led to freelance illustrations for the National Police Gazette—an apprenticeship in action drawings with people and animals and an encounter with the strident world of humans in motion. Sitting in the balcony of MacLevy’s Gym, Calder sketched the boxers punching the bag and each other in preparation for Madison Square Garden fights. He exchanged a canvas for a year’s tuition in boxing and trained between sketching for several months. At $20 for each half-page layout, he sketched Paavo Nurmi and other track stars, the polo players and jumpers at the Horse Show, vaudeville performers and Spanish dancers, skee-ball players and hot-dog stands at Coney Island. He picked up some extra money by decorating the Fifth Avenue store of A.G. Spalding with drawings of athletes. The activities at the Garden led to a turning point in his career. “I went to the circus, Ringling brothers and Barnum & Bailey,” he recounted. “I spent two full weeks there practically every day and night. I could tell by the music what act was getting on and used to rush to some vantage point. Some acts were better seen from above and others from below. At the end of these two weeks, I took a half-page layout to the Police Gazette.” The resulting sketch in the Police Gazette was called Seeing the Circus with Sandy Calder, and it included elephants, dancing bears, three seals, fat men, aerialists, bareback riders and the center ring in motion. After a few years of ink-line drawings in the Gazette, Calder decided that the real artistic action was in Paris—and this was where his wire and wood circus was developed. There seemed to be no master plan leading to his circus. Calder stumbled around the edges of serious art in Paris. “In my quest to earn a living I did portraits of buyers for American stores for the Paris edition of the Herald Tribune, drawings for a weekly called Le Boulevardier, toys and animals for friends, and wire portraits.” His wire figure—today it would be called a significant part of his sculptural development—of Josephine Baker, the black dancer and singer who was the rage of Paris, suggested her bumps and grinds and flying breasts in curlicues of soft metal. One version of “La Baker” stood on a base; a second was designed to be suspended from a thread so it could shake and shimmy in the air. In the artistic atmosphere of Paris in the 1920s, anything experimental, explosive and audacious was encouraged and generally admired. Artists, novelists, poets, sculptors were breaking the classic lines and ideas, cutting out the extraneous and the pretentious. Through a casual meeting with a representative of the Gould Manufacturing Company of Oshkosh, Wisc., Calder invented several toys that moved as they were pulled by children. The company paid him a modest royalty for his action kangaroo, bucking cow, skating bear and other wonderful animals for toddlers. The Oshkosh toys brought Calder one of his first public notices by a critic on The New Yorker, Murdock Pemberton, who said, “A. Calder is a good bet.” “In New York in February, 1928,” Calder told Jean Davidson, “I showed wire animals and people to Carl Zigrosser of the Weyhe Gallery and Bookshop and he decided forthwith to give me a show. My first show. There were about 15 objects and we priced these things at $10 and $20. Two or three were sold. Among those sold was the first Josephine Baker which I had made in Paris. I think it is about then that some lady critic said: ‘Convoluting spirals and concentric entrails; the kid is clever, but what does papa think?’ Father told me once that he was amused by the small wire things, but that my objects were too sharp to be caressed and fondled as one could do with small bronzes.” The Calder circus served several purposes, direct and otherwise. It enabled him to experiment and put movement into figures that could fly through the air with the greatest of ease. It gave his work a theatricality tested with audiences in small rooms—fellow artists, friends, society people and various snobs who watched “Le Plus Petit Cirque du Monde,” as one Paris journal headlined it, because it was the thing to do. The circus crossed the Atlantic in five suitcases, with customs officers never quite sure whether what they passed was art or scrap metal. In the Park Avenue living room of Aline Bernstein, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi ran the Victrola for Calder’s show. Her friend Thomas Wolfe was present, making mental notes for a fictionalized version of the performance in You Can’t Go Home Again, Calder later remarked, “He did not have the good sense to present himself and I only heard from him through some nasty remarks on my performance, included in a long-winded book.” Alexander, Antennae with Red and Blue Dots , 1953. ©ARTISTS RIGHTS SOCIETY (ARS), NEW YORK AND DACS, LONDON, 2015.\nIn Paris, Louisa Calder was usually his assistant and Victoria bandmistress for the circus showings. Among those who saw the show were Mondrian, Miró, Léger, Cocteau, Arp, Man Ray, Pascin, Le Corbusier. Sometimes the hat was passed but, more important, Calder met and learned from the trailblazers of the French art world. Calder’s circus, consisting of 55 figures and animals from a few inches to about a foot in height, include a miniature trapeze ring, lion’s cage, acrobats, sword-swallower, strong man, man on stilts, seals, parachutist, cowboys and wrestlers, stretcher-bearers, etc. Calder installed the circus at the Whitney Museum in New York on an indefinite loan in 1970. When I visited it on the ground floor recently to eavesdrop on what museum visitors were saying, I heard more comments about its cuteness and fun, along with puzzlement that Calder was responsible for this amusing exhibit, than about the historic meaning of it all in the artist’s development. My reaction was initially a feeling that the museum had stuck the circus away in a corner by the cafeteria; but on second thought I realized it was placed where people had to pass it casually rather than to pay a reverential visit—and this seemed in keeping with Calder’s modesty and sense of the ordinary. One day in Paris, Marcel Duchamp came to see Calder’s latest work. He was pleased by the motion that Calder had introduced into his pieces—some cranked by hand, others motor-driven. “I asked him what sort of name I could give these things and he at once produced, ‘mobile,’ ” Calder said. “In addition to something that moves, in French it also means motive. Duchamp also suggested that on my invitation card I make a drawing of the motor-driven object and print: CALDER, SES MOBILES.” The show at the Galerie Vignon arranged by Duchamp attracted most of the artists belonging to the Abstraction-Création movement. Jean Arp was responsible for the name “Stabile” to describe Calder’s non-motion sculpture. One day he casually inquired, “Well, what were those things you did last year—stabiles?” Calder thereafter had names for the major works in his future. His friendship with Joan Miró had begun in 1928 when Miró witnessed a Calder circus performance. Thereafter, Calder would drop in at Miró’s studio. Their ideas blended. Miró’s abstract Surrealism was rooted in organic forms, suggesting an origin in nature rather than pure geometrical forms. Calder’s sculpture developed through the application of Miró’s stylistic ideas translated into abstract forms. His work had names: Calderberry Bush, Goldfish Bowl (his first free-floating, wind-operated mobile), Steel Fish, Whale, Constellations (stabiles and mobiles with organic shapes of painted or polished wood), Whirligig, Southern Cross, Black Widow, Jousting Knight, Snow Plow—all of which required applied imagination of the beholder. But this notion of viewer or reader involvement cuts across arts and letters. Joyce Cary, a modern Renaissance man of literature, wrote that audiences had an obligation to educate themselves so they could comprehend the artist’s form of communication. And what he said about the relationship of art and fact somehow struck me as bearing on Calder’s work: “Only art can convey both the fact and the feeling about the fact, for it works in the medium of common sympathies, common feeling, universal reaction to color, sound, form. It is the bridge between souls.” The tantalizing question in sculpture—and particularly for Calder, whose beginning figures seem so casual—is how the maquette or model or sketch grew to such monumental size in the artist’s mind and under his hand. Robert Osborn once asked him how the increase in the scale of his work started. Calder replied that in 1954 he had done the water ballet for Eero Saarinen’s General Motors technological center in Detroit. He had hundred-foot-high jets of water rising and falling at different speeds. Some of them rotated in different patterns. “Lines of water can be monumental, too,” Calder said. His large metal constructions began to grow when he was working with architects on problem sites and commemorative locations. He executed a 45-foot mobile for Kennedy International Airport, the Whirling Ear (a motorized mobile) for the U.S. Pavilion at the Brussels World’s Fair, the standing mobile for UNESCO in Paris, all between 1957 and 1959. He pierced the sky with his 60-foot-high stabile in Spoleto in 1962. Alexander Calder, White Panel , 1936. CALDER FOUNDATION, NEW YORK/ART RESOURCE, NEW YORK/©ARTISTS RIGHTS SOCIETY (ARS), NEW YORK AND DACS, LONDON, 2014.\nThe architect Eliot Noyes wanted The Black Beast, a stabile 11 feet long by 9 feet high to be remade. It was in a fairly light material, but Noyes’ interest led Calder to have it done in a heavy quarter-inch iron plate, and this encouraged other big works that could stand on their own. In the winter of 1958 Calder had a show of fairly large stabiles at Perls. The following winter a group of large stabiles was exhibited at Maeght’s in Paris; before the opening to the public, Maeght brought the entire show, consisting of 10 major stabiles. Museums continue to vie for Calder stabiles and mobiles. The City, a large stabile with a small mobile element in its center, was brought by Carlos Villaneuva for the Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas. (Cararcas also has one of Calder’s most truly monumental works—his huge sculpture of abstract “clouds” which form an acoustical ceiling in the auditorium at the University there.) Clouds Over the Mountains went to the Chicago Art Institute. The Crab was acquired by James Johnson Sweeney—who had first begun to write about Calder as early as 1935 and had advanced the cause of his work at the Museum of Modern Art—for the Houston Museum of Fine Arts. Between his two houses in Roxbury, Conn., and Saché, France, with his children, grandchildren and friends, with the help of his artistically involved wife, Calder works and steadily enjoys living. “One-man shows by Alexander Calder appear with the regularity, if not frequency, of the rising sun, and like that phenomenon they are eternally refreshing—predictable, even repetitious, but always something to wonder at,” wrote John Canaday in 1972. Talking about a retrospective of paintings, the New York Times critic said that in whatever medium Calder works, he displays the same combination of joy in life, pleasure in the absurd and “an emulsion of innocence and sophistication that ought to curdle and separate like bad Hollandaise but never does.” Calder warms up these days by starting work in a one-room house he calls La Gouacherie, turning out gouaches that use only five colors—black, white, blue, red, yellow. Then he gets down to the heavy work in his metal shop, designing models for stabiles and mobiles. As we talked at Perls, I reached out to touch a small Calder insect, about two feet high, its antennae balanced on a delicate body and legs. Klaus Perls said, “Try taking it apart and see if you can put it together again.” The piece looked simple, but on close examination every part was precisely engineered and in balance. I asked Calder what he called it. He thought for a moment and then said, “Klaus, did you ever give a name to this beastie?” Perls said, “Of course! You named it yourself—La Cucaracha!” Calder laughed, pleased. I inquired if it had any political connotations. “No, just the war against the ants.” I asked him if he had any idea of what some of the younger artists thought of him, and he said matter-of-factly, “Some of them consider me old hat.” Did he have some new direction to take in the future? Would he invent some new form? “Not exactly,” he said, “or I would have done it by now.” At the age of 75, he has done what many artists have been unable to do—to maintain a fresh and liberating outlook, without abridgment. As an “engineer of beauty,” as Osborn calls him, Calder has invented new forms, new ways of looking at the earthbound, heartless work of our time.\n Most-Read Stories Greek Mega-Collector Gives 100 Artworks as Joint Gift to… Hard Truths: Can a Time-Worn Artist Be Called 'Emerging' If… Surreal Things Bored Ape NFT Owners Sue OpenSea Over Stolen Assets.\nArt in America The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

When pressed on this matter in an interview, Calder explained that his penchant for kinetic art and other-worldly forms was his interpretation of what the universe might look like, and was therefore Realism. It is then perhaps fitting that, more than a century since his birth in 1898 (nobody is really sure whether he was born in July or August of that year), his signature mobiles and “staybiles” have transcended the art world to become staple influences for everyone from interior designers and architects to graphic artists and jewellery designers. Enchanting art-lovers globally, and currently piercing the serene landscape of Hauser & Wirth’s rural Somerset home, Calder’s wiry portraits, ethereal mobiles and imposing outdoor installations tell the story of a life lived observing the world through the optimistic eyes of a wonderstruck child. While his love of of bold colour, simple shapes and asymmetrical choreography appears infantile, his fascination with suspension and balance reflects the intrinsic struggle for equilibrium synonymous with the Surrealist movement of the 1920s and 30s.\n Red, White, Black and Brass 1934.\nAlexander Calder, Calder Foundation, New York; Promised Gift of Alexander S.

Clearly recognising a shared appreciation for cross-disciplinary vision, architect du jour Gio Ponti included an oversized black Calder mobile in his 1955 Caracas project Villa Planchart. Peggy Guggenheim was also a fan of the sculptor’s work, and in many portraits can be seen posing alongside one of his pieces, almost as if it were a partner to her in a moment of solitude. Calder was the artist’s artist. His work broke boundaries and expectation and provided new and unexpected ways to experience space. His art and eccentric charm captured the imaginations of his art-world peers, including Georgia O’Keeffe, whose home in Abiqui, New Mexico was adorned with one of his mobiles. In an award-winning 1998 documentary directed by Roger Sherman, writer Brendan Gill says: “Up until Calder’s time, sculpture was a expression of solidity, of motionlessness. It turns out that something else was possible. The flight of the bird was possible, or the seeming flight of the bird. It says that we are ourselves more than Earth-bound.” “Up until Calder’s time, sculpture was a expression of solidity, of motionlessness. It turns out that something else was possible.

This respite from mundanity is perhaps what continues to see design and fashion professionals take inspiration from his unique portfolio. Lending itself to jewellery design in particular, the sculptor’s love of movement and abstraction can be recognised in recent offerings by Céline, among others. A People magazine article from December 1974 states that in the 18 months prior to publication, “More than $1,000,000 in massive Calders have gone up in Hartford, Fort Worth, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington.” In the same article, Calder – then 76 – is quoted admitting that 1974 was his best year ever, “Mainly because city after US city discovered that Calder’s gigantic abstractions are just the ticket to fill the void left by urban renewal and the passing from fashion of granite generals on horseback.”.\nBird ornament c. 1945.\nAlexander Calder © 2018 Calder Foundation, New York / DACS London.\nApple Monster (1938), Yucca (1941, centre rear), Black Beast [maquette] (1939), and Myrtle Burl (1941), Roxbury studio, 1941.\nHerbert Matter © 2018 Calder Foundation, New York / DACS, London.\nCalder’s enduring popularity might be attributed to his relentless sense of grounding, in spite of his outlandish and oversized style. As demonstrated in From the Stony River to the Sky at Hauser & Wirth, the artist was enamoured with occasion and theatre and took any opportunity to add an air of pantomime or performance to everyday life. The personal projects and possessions exhibited (many for the first time) demonstrate the breadth of his imagination and the complete lack of contextual constraint attached to his motivation. Having already moved to Paris in 1926, where he was inspired by the circus and its acrobats, Calder was travelling by boat to New York in June 1929 when he met Louisa James. The pair married in 1931 and in 1933 bought a farm in Roxbury, Connecticut. It was this house that the artist filled with domestic creations that would’ve looked more at home in a gallery than a kitchen, yet were much used and loved and are now cared for by the Calder Foundation, whose president is Calder’s own grandson, Alexander S. C. Rower. It was also this home that inspired the artist to explore outdoor sculpture for the first time, in 1934. The land belonging to the farm provided him with a private playground fertile with potential. There is an accessibility to appreciating Calder’s work that doesn’t condescend or exclude those new to the world of art. The artist’s honesty about his own vision and sources of inspiration has allowed for an unpretentious enjoyment of colour, shape and movement that is often reserved for children. When speculating on the catalyst for and longevity of his influence on contemporary culture, perhaps it could be said that Calder’s work is a gentle nudge – not unlike the encouragement between parent and child – tempting us to find joy in movement and simplicity, adding play to the everyday.\n Untitled, c. 1946 Alexander Calder © 2018 Calder Foundation, New York / DACS London.\nAlexander Calder, From the Stony River to the Sky runs until September 9, 2018 at Hauser & Wirth Somerset.\n Design & Living Design Digest Exhibitions Interiors.\nSubscribe to the weekly AnOther newsletter I would like to receive the AnOther newsletter \n", "label": [[0, 15, "DATE"], [49, 55, "ARTIST"], [61, 66, "WORK_OF_ART"], [68, 72, "DATE"], [78, 89, "WORK_OF_ART"], [91, 95, "DATE"], [97, 113, "ARTIST"], [115, 131, "GALLERY"], [132, 145, "COLLECTOR"], [147, 155, "GPE"], [157, 161, "DATE"], [162, 178, "ARTIST"], [180, 196, "GALLERY"], [197, 210, "COLLECTOR"], [212, 220, "GPE"], [222, 226, "DATE"], [229, 233, "DATE"], [234, 251, "GALLERY"], [253, 261, "GPE"], [269, 275, "GPE"], [350, 362, "DATE"], [375, 382, "GPE"], [413, 429, "ARTIST"], [520, 526, "ARTIST"], [755, 759, "DATE"], [1108, 1122, "GALLERY"], [1131, 1139, "GPE"], [1146, 1152, "ARTIST"], [1563, 1568, "DATE"], [1573, 1576, "DATE"], [1579, 1606, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1607, 1611, "DATE"], [1613, 1629, "ARTIST"], [1631, 1648, "GALLERY"], [1650, 1658, "GPE"], [1701, 1705, "DATE"], [1706, 1723, "GALLERY"], [1725, 1733, "GPE"], [1741, 1747, "GPE"], [1749, 1765, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1767, 1771, "DATE"], [1774, 1790, "GALLERY"], [1791, 1804, "COLLECTOR"], [1806, 1814, "GPE"], [1816, 1820, "DATE"], [1823, 1827, "DATE"], [1828, 1845, "GALLERY"], [1847, 1855, "GPE"], [1863, 1869, "GPE"], [1943, 1950, "ARTIST"], [2170, 2175, "DATE"], [2306, 2312, "ARTIST"], [2327, 2331, "DATE"], [2332, 2339, "GPE"], [2348, 2363, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2365, 2381, "COLLECTOR"], [2554, 2560, "ARTIST"], [2774, 2790, "ARTIST"], [2806, 2824, "GPE"], [2882, 2886, "DATE"], [2962, 2968, "ARTIST"], [3219, 3225, "ARTIST"], [3467, 3479, "ARTIST"], [3481, 3486, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3488, 3492, "DATE"], [3493, 3509, "ARTIST"], [3511, 3528, "GALLERY"], [3530, 3538, "GPE"], [3572, 3576, "DATE"], [3577, 3594, "GALLERY"], [3596, 3604, "GPE"], [3612, 3618, "GPE"], [3624, 3634, "GPE"], [3639, 3647, "GPE"], [3704, 3710, "ARTIST"], [4125, 4138, "DATE"], [4201, 4211, "MONEY"], [4223, 4229, "ARTIST"], [4247, 4255, "GPE"], [4257, 4267, "GPE"], [4269, 4276, "GPE"], [4278, 4289, "GPE"], [4291, 4303, "GPE"], [4308, 4318, "GPE"], [4342, 4348, "ARTIST"], [4356, 4358, "DATE"], [4386, 4390, "DATE"], [4404, 4408, "DATE"], [4442, 4444, "GPE"], [4466, 4472, "ARTIST"], [4638, 4642, "DATE"], [4644, 4660, "ARTIST"], [4663, 4667, "DATE"], [4668, 4685, "GALLERY"], [4687, 4695, "GPE"], [4703, 4709, "GPE"], [4711, 4724, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4726, 4730, "DATE"], [4733, 4738, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4740, 4744, "DATE"], [4760, 4771, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4784, 4788, "DATE"], [4795, 4806, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4808, 4812, "DATE"], [4815, 4822, "GPE"], [4831, 4835, "DATE"], [4837, 4851, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4854, 4858, "DATE"], [4859, 4876, "GALLERY"], [4878, 4886, "GPE"], [4895, 4901, "GPE"], [4903, 4909, "ARTIST"], [5066, 5088, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5092, 5106, "GALLERY"], [5460, 5465, "GPE"], [5469, 5473, "DATE"], [5529, 5535, "ARTIST"], [5562, 5570, "GPE"], [5574, 5583, "DATE"], [5630, 5634, "DATE"], [5642, 5646, "DATE"], [5664, 5684, "GPE"], [5872, 5889, "GALLERY"], [5910, 5916, "ARTIST"], [6055, 6059, "DATE"], [6197, 6203, "ARTIST"], [6579, 6585, "ARTIST"], [6751, 6759, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6764, 6768, "DATE"], [6769, 6785, "ARTIST"], [6788, 6792, "DATE"], [6793, 6810, "GALLERY"], [6812, 6820, "GPE"], [6828, 6834, "GPE"], [6836, 6852, "ARTIST"], [6854, 6885, "EVENT"], [6897, 6914, "DATE"], [6918, 6932, "GALLERY"], [6933, 6941, "GPE"]]}
{"id": 138, "data": "Home > A closer look > 10 Things to Know About Alexander Calder.\nA closer look • 26 Oct 2020.\n10 Things to Know About Alexander Calder #Alexander Calder #Arman #Léonard Foujita #Man Ray #Marcel Duchamp #Piet Mondrian.\nAgnès Varda, Calder with 21 feuilles blanches (1953), Paris, 1954 Alexander Calder, the inventor of the “mobile” and kinetic art… he was a master of gracefully balancing industrial materials with nature, making them work in perfect harmony.  This major artist of the 20th-century changed the landscape of sculpture, introducing a new and delicate slant to this art form. Having worked beside Miro, Arman and Mondrian, today he is one of the most popular artists in the market. He is acclaimed by all the most highly regarded museums in the world and present in the most prestigious collections. Uncover 10 things to know about this artist who broke with conventions… He was the pioneer of the mobile and kinetic art  Mobile , metal, wood, wire and string, 1932.\nAlexander Calder was the pioneer of the “mobile” that we know today, and the founder of kinetic art.  The name “mobile” was gifted by Marcel Duchamp. This new structure broke with the conventions of sculpture in his contemporary setting. Calder’s sculptures were incredibly delicate and, crucially, they moved. Initially, Calder’s sculptures moved due to the use of motors. However, eventually they evolved to move due to natural forces. The sculptures were designed in such a way that they would catch the air currents in a room or the breeze outside, a revolutionary concept in the world of art. Hand in hand with the introduction of these “mobiles”, came the introduction of “stabiles”. This name was given by abstract artist, Jean Arp, to Calder’s previous stationary sculptures. 6 58542.\nHe is known for ‘drawing in space’ Kiki de Montparnasse (II) , 1930, on display at the Centre Pompidou.\nThe term ‘drawing in space’ was first used in reference to Calder in the French newspaper Paris-Midi. This came after one of his first solo exhibitions in 1929 in which Calder showcased his wire sculptures. The description stuck and was often used subsequently to describe Calder’s works. The term was also apt for Calder as he would carry bits of wire with him and fashion images of what he saw in the streets. Famously, he enjoyed creating wire portraits of people he met – one of his most well known was of the actress, Kiki, in 1929. Calder was particularly drawn to her nose which seemed to “launch off into space”. He came from an artistic background Photo credit: Thomas Powell Imaging, Dog (1909) and Duck (1909).\nComing from an artistic family, it is not hard to see how Calder ended up being such a pillar of the art world, although it was not his parents who pushed him into this career. His father, also called Alexander Calder, was a sculptor himself, so he knew the hardships that came with being an artist. He used to call his son ‘the garbage man’ as his pockets were always brimming with pebbles, string and odd bits and bobs. From an early age Calder showed an interest in sculpture and using his hands to mold the world around him. At the age of 11, his sister bought him a pair of pliers for Christmas. He used these to make two little brass sculptures for his mother and father, one of a duck and another of a dog. Metal went on to be his principal medium. His work uses bits of old wire and wood, showcasing how beauty can be created out of unwanted scraps. 6 4456.\nHe was a mechanical engineer turned sculptor Photo credit: Georges Meguerditchian – Centre Pompidou, Joséphine Baker (IV), Danse, 1928.\nCalder studied mechanical engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology, graduating in 1921. However, whilst working on a ship in 1922, it was on seeing the red sun off the shore of Guatemala that he was reminded of his artistic upbringing.   He turned his back on this lifestyle, initially moving to New York where he worked as an artist for several newspapers until he eventually moved to the art hub, Paris, in 1926. During his time in Paris he began sketching people in the streets and making little wire figurines in his hotel room. One of the first characters he made was Josephine Baker who was renowned across the globe for her Charleston dancing. It was this movement and energy that Calder tried to capture in his models of her. Although his work never specifically relied on the knowledge he gained during his studies, it seems undeniable that his skills influenced his perfectly assembled sculptures. In fact, later in his career he stated: “When I work on something, I have two things in mind. The first is to make it more alive. The second is always to bear in mind the balance of it.” He was always drawn to the circus Calder’s Circus , 1926 – 1931, on display at the Witney Foundation of Arts.\nCalder sought to represent and capture movement in all his works throughout his lifetime. This fascination started whilst living in New York. For two weeks he visited the circus, a melting pot for the whole of society. Here he drew and painted the spectacles that he saw, trying to capture the animation of the environment. He would return to this inspiration throughout his career. After moving to Paris, Calder created a miniature circus made out of wire and wooden blocks. It included characters such as a heavy weight lifter, a horseman and a clown. These were brought to life by Calder pulling different strings. His first performance was in his hotel room to some of his friends. One of these performances attracted Legrand-Chabrier, a renowned circus critic at the time. It was he who was the first to put Calder in the spotlight, writing an article about Calder’s humble but genius circus, titled; “Un Petit Cirque à Domicile”. In 1929, Calder linked with Léonard Foujita, the Japanese-French painter and printmaker. Together they worked on Calder’s circus performances. Calder provided the circus and Foujita the music. These became increasingly popular and artists and intellectuals across Paris became interested. Visitors included the likes of Kiki, Marcel Duchamp, Jean Cocteau and Man Ray. The circus became so popular that by the beginning of the 30s it had grown from 15 to 200 figurines. He was inspired by meeting Mondrian Untitled abstract painting, 1930 after meeting Piet Mondrian In 1930 Calder was invited to Piet Mondrian’s studio in Paris. Here Calder was inspired by the colorful squares dotted over the white walls of the studio. With this image, complemented by the light streaming into the space, Calder suggested to Mondrian that he set the squares into motion. To this Mondrian responded: ‘No it is not necessary, my painting is already very fast…’. Nevertheless, this encounter inspired Calder to pursue movement with even more vigour. After meeting Mondrian and encountering abstract art for the first time, Calder locked himself away painting simple canvases that aligned with this idea. However, he quickly grew tired from this medium. But, having been exposed to simple shapes and arcs, he began to view figurative representation as limiting. In his next exhibition Volumes, Vectors, Densities at the Galerie Percier, he presented sculptures made from different elements of a circle. Following on from this exhibition, Calder came to be regarded as a serious contender in the world of abstract art. 6 6785.\nThe War Years altered the materials he used for his sculptures Constellation Mobile , made from wood, wire, string, paint, 1943.\nThe War Years brought with them a shortage of sheet metal. This posed a problem for Calder who relied on this material to create his masterpieces. Usually he would cut sheet metal into pieces that he would then assemble into his mobiles.  However, this did not phase Calder. Instead the shortage brought with it a new era for Calder who turned to more natural materials. Wood and wire became his new tools. With this new medium, Calder created his Constellations series in the 1940s, so called because the sculptures resembled the Cosmos. He has had multiple giant structures displayed across the globe “L’Homme” (The Man) , Montreal, 1967.\nLater in his career Calder was often commissioned to create giant structures. For example, The Red Spider (1976) and Spiral (1958) in Paris, and Flamingo (1974) in Chicago. In order to create these structures he would first make models of them, then they would come to fruition in one of his studios. One of the largest of these sculptures was Man (1967) which was installed in Montreal and stood at 65 feet. These monumental sculptures could be found in cities and the countryside alike and are the principal examples of Calder’s “stabiles”. He once collaborated with an airline Collaboration with Braniff International Airways, 1973 In 1973, Calder was commissioned to design the outside of an aeroplane in his typical bright style by Braniff International Airways. This project came to be known as Flying Colours, primarily flying to South America. The outside of the plane, instead of having the airline’s logo, had Calder’s signature on the outside. In 1975, he was commissioned to decorate another plane, which came to be known as Flying Colours of the United States. He never wanted to be defined by a particular artistic movement Steel Fish , 1934, the first of Calder’s sculptures to be exposed to the elements.\nAlthough mingling with the abstract artists of the day, Calder never sought to be defined by a particular artistic movement. In fact he was specifically anti this concept. He was of the opinion that when an artist defined themselves, this was when they became limited. Instead he believed that when an artist was attempting to explain their work, they should in fact be challenging their ideas. About his own work, Steel Fish (1934), he stated: ‘this is completely useless and meaningless. It’s just beautiful, that is all. It can make you very emotional if you understand it, of course, if it had some meaning it would be easier to understand’. To conclude, Alexander Calder truly underwent an evolution throughout his career. From his original wire portraits to his monumental sculptures, Calder’s creations were the result of true artist exploration. He drew on inspiration from everyone and everything he encountered throughout his life. However, he managed to maintain his true to his values and beliefs throughout his life, allowing him to create truly forward thinking sculptures. Ultimately, these qualities meant he completely transformed sculpture as we knew it into a lighter and more playful art form. 6 3003.\nRelated articles 15 May 2018 10 Artists Who Explore Geometric Abstraction Geometric abstraction evolved from the Cubist destruction of form and space.

{"id": 143, "data": "Alicja Kwade From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search German artist Alicja Kwade Alicja Kwade photograph by Oliver Mark , Berlin 2014.\nBorn 1979 ( 1979 ).\nKatowice , Poland.\nEducation Berlin University of the Arts Chelsea College of Arts.\nKnown for sculpture.\nPartner(s) Gregor Hildebrandt.\nAlicja Kwade (born 1979, Poland) is a Polish-German[1] contemporary visual artist. Her sculptures and installations focus on the subjectivity of time and space. Kwade lives and works in Berlin.[2] Contents 1 Early life and education.\n2 Work.\n2.1 Studios.\n2.2 Commissions.\n3 Exhibitions.\n4 Recognition.\n5 Personal life.\n6 References.\n7 Further reading.\n8 External links.\nEarly life and education[edit] Kwade was born in the industrial city of Katowice, of what was then communist Poland.[3] She was the daughter of a cultural scientist and gallery owner and conservator, and reports knowing that she wanted to be an artist at as young as five years old. Her family escaped to West Germany in 1987.[1] She grew up in Hannover and at age 19 moved to Berlin were she studied sculpture at the Berlin University of the Arts from 1999 to 2005.[1] In 2002, Kwade spent an Erasmus year at Chelsea College of Arts in London. Work[edit] Kwade manipulates common materials like wood, glass, and copper through chemical processes to explore the ephemerality of the physical world. Her works often include reflection, repetitive sounds, and inaccurate doubling to create immersive and experiential spaces that beg viewers to question their perception of reality.[4] In a 2013 interview with ArtReview magazine, Kwade explained “I’m fascinated with the borders between science and suspicion. All the in-betweens. Mr Houdini is one of my biggest heroes.” In 2017, Kwade was photographed by Mario Testino for Vogue in Venice.[5] First shown at MIT List Visual Arts Center in 2020, the installation Light Touch of Totality is made up of five stainless steel rings, each about 16 feet in diameter, which appear frozen in time at various angles and points of contact. Curtains of stringed beads hang from different parts of the rings, and ungulate slightly with movement of the air in the room. The ring are representative of both planetary rings and longitudinal lines, while the beads represent units of information. In this way, the work aligns with Kwade’s persistent interest in perception and the ways we categorize and understand our world. Studios[edit] Since becoming a full-time artist, Kwade has worked from studios in Berlin's Kreuzberg (2008-2011, together with Thomas Kiesewetter)[6] and Weißensee districts (2012-2018). She also completed an artist-in-residence program in Le Vauclin in 2012. In 2018, she moved her practice to a studio in Oberschöneweide, alongside Olafur Eliasson, Christian Jankowski and Jorinde Voigt.[7] Commissions[edit] For her first solo public art commission in the United States in 2015, Kwade installed a 16-feet-tall aluminium a 19th-century style clock titled Against the Run (2015) at the entrance to Central Park, directly opposite the storied Plaza Hotel; the clock's face moved counter clockwise while the hour and minute hands turned in the opposite direction.[8][9] As part of a 2021 revitalization project of 550 Madison Avenue, Kwade created Solid Sky (2021), a work comprising a nearly 22,000 kilogram polished spherical quartzite suspended from the ceiling of the glassbox lobby with stainless steel chains.[10] Exhibitions[edit] Beginning with her first institutional show at Hamburger Bahnhof in 2008, Kwade had solo exhibitions at Kestnergesellschaft in Hannover; Kunsthalle Schirn in Frankfurt (2015); and Whitechapel Gallery, London (2016); among others. She also participated in the 2015 Venice Biennale. She also produced Parapivot for the 2019 Metropolitan Museum of Art Roof Garden Commission.[11][12] Recognition[edit] 2002 – German Academic Scholarship Foundation.\n2010 – Robert Jacobsen Prize, Würth Foundation 2015 – Hector Prize, Kunsthalle Mannheim.\nPersonal life[edit] Since 2000, Kwade has been in a relationship with fellow artist Gregor Hildebrandt.[13] References[edit] ^ a b c.\nThomas Rogers (March 29, 2019), On the Met Roof, Alicja Kwade's Test of Faith New York Times .\n ^ Ken Johnson (December 20, 2012), Alicja Kwade: ‘The Heavy Weight of Light’ New York Times .\n ^ Great women artists .

Using double-sided mirrors and carefully placed, paired objects, Alicja Kwade achieves the illusion of sudden and surprising material transformations. Mirrored panels reflect part of an object, yet at the same time, a mirror image of the same object is revealed. In this way a new, illusionary object is created through the overlaying of reality and appearance. As viewers move around and through Kwade’s steel-framed hexagonal structure, the way one reads and understands the objects within it shifts dramatically, depending on perspective. WeltenLinie is more of an experience than a static installation, which comes to life through the viewers movement within the structure. In her cross-media work, Alicja Kwade deals with perceptual structures and basic physical laws. Optical experiences and their deceptions characterise her creations, which regularly transgress and question habitual ways of perception. ABOUT\nAlicja Kwade’s work investigates concepts of space, time, science and philosophy, and takes shape in sculptural objects, public installations, video and photography. In 2019, Kwade was selected for the Roof Garden Commission at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and in 2017 she participated in the 57th Venice Biennale Viva Arte Viva. Recent exhibitions include solo shows at MIT List Visual Arts Centre, Boston (2019); Kunsthal Charlottenborg, Copenhagen (2018); Haus Konstruktiv, Zürich (2018); and YUZ Museum, Shanghai (2018).

What these components offer the eye is a physical reality generated by a process of transmutation. A sort of alchemy nonetheless free of any mystical ambitions. Anxious to maintain a link with prosaic things, Kwade strives for a visible traceability with the objects or motifs, often close to hand, as well as with the materials (like gold, lead, copper) on which she has set her sights. Time and space are likewise summoned up in Kwade’s sculptures, which combine improbable funnels with interlocking geometrical modules. One might be tempted to establish a shared genealogy for the two, except that their interlocking reveals no prior history and it is highly probable that, as in a symbiotic entity, a common growth has sealed their evolution. In any case, the copper funnels trace vectors defining a three-dimensional reality and, of course, evoke instruments which are creating music through the vibration of their resonant bodies. Some of the variables in her approach refer to abstract concepts, starting with string theory, which she cites as one of the references for her tubular sculptures. Others are “ordinary”. But they systematically reflect a poetic quality, like a lamp covered with fabric and set in bronze, concealing its morphology. An enigmatic “world base”. A pair of balancing acts formed by a light bulb and a stone driven by a gravitational and centrifugal force. Not to mention a simple clock with an out-of-sync second hand, as if in the grip of a strange natural force. This quality becomes meaningful if we remember that the word poem in its German translation, Gedicht, refers to density (Dichte). Like day density. — Erik Verhagen Born in 1979 in Katowice, Poland, ALICJA KWADE lives and works in Berlin. Her work was exhibited in multiple solo shows in museums and institutions such as the Langen Foundation, Neuss; the MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Centre de Création Contemporaine Olivier Debré – CCCOD, Tours; the Kunsthal Charlottenborg, Copenhagen; the Haus Konstruktiv, Zurich; the YUZ Museum, Shanghai; the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, Michigan; the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden- Baden; the Whitechapel Gallery in London; the Public Art Fund in New York. In 2019, she was commissioned to create a site-specific monumental installation for The Met’s Roof Garden in New York. Alicja Kwade also took part of international events all around the world: Helsinki Biennial, Desert X, Coachella in 2021; NGV Triennial 2020; Setouchi Triennale 2019; the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017 and the Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2016.

Her mother, Raquel Oti de Rojas, was a chemist, a researcher, and the granddaughter of Carlos Maria de Rojas, a sugar mill owner celebrated for his role in the war against Spain for Cuban independence.[3][4][5] Ana, aged 12, and her 15-year-old sister Raquelin were sent to the United States by their parents to live in Dubuque, Iowa[6] through Operation Peter Pan, a collaborative program, run by the US government and the Catholic Charities, for Cuban children to flee Fidel Castro's dictatorship.[7] Ana and Raquelin were among 14,000 children who immigrated to the United States through this program in 1961. Mendieta's first two years in the United States consisted of constant alternation between foster homes and orphanages. The sisters were able to stay together during this time due to a power of attorney signed by their parents, which mandated that they not be separated.[8] The two sisters spent their first weeks in refugee camps, and then moved between several institutions and foster homes throughout Iowa.[1] In 1966, Mendieta was reunited with her mother and younger brother. Her father joined them in 1979, having spent 18 years in a political prison in Cuba for his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion.[1] Education[edit] In Cuba, Mendieta grew up as a sheltered, upper-class child. She attended an all-girls Catholic private school. When she and her sister were sent to Iowa, they were enrolled in a reform school because the court wanted to avoid sending them to a state institution.[9] When Mendieta studied English in school, her vocabulary was very limited. In junior high school, she discovered a love for art.[8] Mendieta was first a French major and art minor, but when she transferred to the University of Iowa, she was inspired by the avant-garde community and the hills of Iowa's landscape.[10] She earned a BA (enrolled 1969–1972) and MA in painting, and an MFA (enrolled 1972–1977) in Intermedia under the instruction of acclaimed artist Hans Breder.[11] In college, Mendieta's work focused on blood and violence toward women. Her interest in spiritualism, religion, and primitive rituals developed during this time.[12] She said that she faced a great deal of discrimination in art school. After graduate school, she moved to New York City.[8] Work[edit] In the course of her career, Mendieta created work in Cuba, Mexico, Italy, and the United States.[11] Her work was somewhat autobiographical, drawing from her history of being displaced from her native Cuba, and focused on themes including feminism, violence, life, death, identity, place and belonging. Her works are generally associated with the four basic elements of nature. Mendieta often focused on a spiritual and physical connection with the Earth. She felt that by uniting her body with the earth she could become whole again: \"Through my earth/body sculptures, I become one with the earth ... I become an extension of nature and nature becomes an extension of my body. This obsessive act of reasserting my ties with the earth is really the reactivation of primeval beliefs ... [in] an omnipresent female force, the after image of being encompassing within the womb, is a manifestation of my thirst for being.\"[13] During her lifetime, Mendieta produced over 200 works of art using earth as a sculptural medium.[14] Her techniques were mainly influenced by Afro-Cuban traditions.[15] Rape Scene 1973 Moffit Street, Iowa City, Iowa[edit] In 1973, Mendieta performed Rape Scene which commented on the rape and murder of a fellow student that had occurred on the Iowa University campus by another student.[16]  In the performance Mendieta invited friends and other students to visit her in her Moffit Street apartment.[17]  Upon arriving at her apartment, viewers were confronted with the image of Mendieta, naked from the waist down, smeared with blood, bent over, and bound to a table.[18]  The work reflects Mendieta’s emotional reaction to the occurrence of sexual assault on the university campus.[19] Membership in Artists In Residence Inc[edit] In 1978, Ana Mendieta joined the Artists In Residence Inc (A.I.R. Gallery) in New York, which was the first gallery for women to be established in the United States. The venture gave her the opportunity to network with other women artists at the forefront of the era's feminist movement.[20] During that time, Mendieta was also actively involved in the administration and maintenance of the A.I.R. In an unpublished statement, she noted, \"It is crucial for me to be a part of all my art works. As a result of my participation, my vision becomes a reality and part of my experiences.\"[20] At the same time, after two years of involvement with A.I.R. she concluded that \"American Feminism as it stands is basically a white middle class movement,\" and she sought to challenge the limits of this perspective through her art.[21] She met her future husband Carl Andre at the gallery, when he served on a panel titled \"How has women's art practices affected male artist social attitudes?\"[22] Her resignation in 1982 is attributed, in part, to a dispute instigated by Andre over a collaborative art piece the couple had submitted. In a 2001 journal article, Kat Griefen, director of A.I.R from 2006 to 2011,[23] wrote, The letter of resignation did not cite any reasons for her departure, but a number of fellow A.I.R. artists remember the related events. For a recent benefit Mendieta and Carl Andre had donated a collaborative piece. As was the policy, all works needed to be delivered by the artist. Edelson recalls that Andre took offense, instigating a disagreement, which, in part, led to Mendieta's resignation. Even without this incident, according to another member, Pat Lasch, Mendieta's association with the now legendary Andre surely played some role in her decision.[20] In 1983, Mendieta was awarded the Rome Prize by the American Academy in Rome. While in residence in Rome, Mendieta began creating art \"objects,\" including drawings and sculptures.[24] She continued to use natural elements in her work.[25] Silueta Series (1973–1980)[edit] The Silueta Series (1973–1980) involved Mendieta creating female silhouettes in nature—in mud, sand, and grass—with natural materials ranging from leaves and twigs to blood, and making body prints or painting her outline or silhouette onto a wall.[26] In a 1981 artist statement, Mendieta said: I have been carrying out a dialogue between the landscape and the female body (based on my own silhouette). I believe this has been a direct result of my having been torn from my homeland (Cuba) during my adolescence. I am overwhelmed by the feeling of having been cast from the womb (nature). My art is the way I re-establish the bonds that unite me to the universe. It is a return to the maternal source.[27] When she began her Silueta Series in the 1970s, Mendieta was one of many artists experimenting with the emerging genres of land art, body art, and performance art. The films and photographs of Siluetas are in connection with the figures surrounding her body. Mendieta was possibly the first to combine these genres in what she called \"earth-body\" sculptures.[28] She often used her naked body to explore and connect with the Earth, as seen in her piece Imagen de Yagul, from the series Silueta Works in Mexico 1973–1977.[29] Mendieta's first use of blood to make art dates from 1972, when she performed Untitled (Death of a Chicken), for which she stood naked in front of a white wall holding a freshly decapitated chicken by its feet as its blood spattered her naked body.[30] Appalled by the brutal rape and murder of nursing student Sarah Ann Ottens at the University of Iowa, Mendieta smeared herself with blood and had herself tied to a table in 1973, inviting an audience in to bear witness in Untitled (Rape Scene).[31][32] Professor and art historian Kaira Cabañas writes about Untitled (Rape Scene): Her body was the subject and object of the work. She used it to emphasize the societal conditions by which the female body is colonized as the object of male desire and ravaged under masculine aggression.  Mendieta's corporeal presence demanded the recognition of a female subject. The previously invisible, unnamed victim of rape gained an identity. The audience was forced to reflect on its responsibility; its empathy was elicited and translated to the space of awareness in which sexual violence could be addressed.[6] In a slide series, People Looking at Blood Moffitt (1973), she pours blood and rags on a sidewalk and photographs a seemingly endless stream of people walking by without stopping, until the man next door (the storefront window bears the name H.F. Moffitt) comes out to clean it up.[32] Mendieta also created the female silhouette using nature as both her canvas and her medium. She used her body to create silhouettes in the grass; she created silhouettes in sand and dirt; she created silhouettes of fire and filmed them burning. Untitled (Ochún) (1981), named for the Santería goddess of waters, once pointed southward from the shore at Key Biscayne, Florida. Ñañigo Burial (1976), with a title taken from the popular name for an Afro-Cuban religious brotherhood, is a floor installation of black candles dripping wax in the outline of the artist's body.[2] Through these works, which cross the boundaries of performance, film, and photography, Mendieta explored her relationship with a place as well as a larger relationship with mother Earth or the \"Great Goddess\" figure.[14] Mary Jane Jacob suggests in her exhibition catalog Ana Mendieta: The \"Silueta\" Series (1973–1980) that much of Mendieta's work was influenced by her interest in the religion Santería, as well as a connection to Cuba. Jacob attributes Mendieta's \"ritualistic use of blood,\" and the use of gunpowder, earth, and rock, to Santería's ritualistic traditions.[33] Jacob also points out the significance of the mother figure, referring to the Mayan deity Ix Chel, the mother of the gods.[34] Many have interpreted Mendieta's recurring use of this mother figure, and her own female silhouette, as feminist art. However, because Mendieta's work explores many ideas including life, death, identity, and place all at once, it cannot be categorized as part of one idea or movement.[citation needed] Claire Raymond argues that the Silueta Series, as a photographic archive, should be read for its photographicity rather than merely as documentation of earthworks.[35] In Corazon de Roca con Sangre (Rock Heart with Blood) (1975) Mendieta kneels next to an impression of her body that has been cut into the soft muddy riverbank.[10] Photo etchings of the Rupestrian Sculptures (1981)[edit] As documented in the book Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works, edited by Bonnie Clearwater, before her death, Mendieta was working on a series of photo-etchings of cave sculptures she had created at Escaleras de Jaruco, Jaruco State Park in Havana, Cuba.[36] Her sculptures were entitled Rupestrian Sculptures (1981)—the title refers to living among rocks[37]—and the book of photographic etchings that Mendieta created to preserve these sculptures is a testament to the intertextuality of her work. Clearwater explains that the photographs of Mendieta's sculptures were often as important as the piece they were documenting because the nature of Mendieta's work was so impermanent. She spent as much time and thought on the creation of the photographs as she did on the sculptures themselves.[36] Mendieta returned to Havana, the place of her birth, for this project, but she was still exploring her sense of displacement and loss, according to Clearwater.[38] The Rupestrian Sculptures that Mendieta created were also influenced by the Taíno people, \"native inhabitants of the pre-Hispanic Antilles,\" whom Mendieta became fascinated by and studied.[39] Mendieta had completed five photo-etchings of the Rupestrian Sculptures before she died in 1985. The book Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works, published in 1993, contains both photographs of the sculptures and Mendieta's notes on the project.[40] Body Tracks (1982)[edit] Body Tracks (Rastros Corporales) debuted on April 8, 1982, in Franklin Furnace in New York City.[41]  The tracks are long, blurry marks made by Mendieta on a large piece of white paper attached to a wall.   While recordings of the sacred music of Afro-Cuban Santeria were heard,[6] Mendieta dipped her hands and forearms into a mixture of tempera paint and animal blood, pressed her hands and arms firmly to the paper's surface, and slid down towards the floor.[41][42] The performance was documented in the 1987 film Ana Mendieta: Fuego de Tierra,[43] and described by scholar Alexandra Gonzenbach: In the short piece, the artist enters the studio space, while Cuban music plays in the background. She dips her hands and forearms into animal blood, places her back to the camera, lifts her arms and places them on a large sheet of white paper attached to a wall, and then proceeds to slowly drag her arms down the page, until almost reaching the bottom. She then walks off screen and out of the performance space. The camera, documentation, and performance stops.[44] The resultant pieces of paper were preserved by the artist after the event, and appear now as works of art in their own right in the collection of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University.[41]  A still photo from the exhibit was the cover art of the Third Woman Press edition of the feminist anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (2002, ISBN 0943219221) Film works (1971–1980)[edit] In the 1970s Mendieta made number of experimental films. These include: Creek (1974) [45] This film builds on the Shakespearean character of Ophelia . It was shot in San Felipe Creek , Oaxaca, Mexico . In the film, Mendieta merges with the water. [46].\nOchún (1981) [45] Mendieta filmed Ochun in Key Biscayne, Florida . It is about the Santería goddess, Ochún -- the Orisha of the river. It features sand silhouettes, seagull sounds, and ocean waves, and emphasizes themes of longing for another land. It was her last film. [46].\nChicken Movie, Chicken Piece (1972) Parachute (1973) Moffitt Building Piece (1973) Grass Breathing (1974) Dog (1974) Mirage (1974) Weather Balloon, Feathered Balloon (1974) Silueta Sangrienta (1975) Energy Charge (1975) [45].\nIn 2016 a traveling exhibition of her film work was mounted by the Katherine E. Nash Gallery of the University of Minnesota with the title Covered in Time and History: The Films of Ana Mendieta.[47] Film works released posthumously (1985–present)[edit] The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, and family members found several films after her death while looking for work to be included in a retrospective at the New Museum in 1987. In 2016, more films were uncovered and digitized in anticipation of a documentary directed by the artist's niece, Raquel Cecilia Mendieta.[48] Pain of Cuba/Body I Am (2018) The Earth That Covers Us Speaks (2018).\nExhibitions and collections[edit] Mendieta presented a solo exhibition of her photographs at A.I.R. Gallery in New York in 1979.[1] She also curated and wrote the introductory catalog essay for an exhibition at A.I.R. in 1981 entitled Dialectics of Isolation: An Exhibition of Third World Women Artists of the United States, which featured the work of artists such as Judy Baca, Senga Nengudi, Howardena Pindell, and Zarina.[49] The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York hosted Mendieta's first survey exhibition in 1987. Since her death, Mendieta has been recognized with international solo museum retrospectives such as Ana Mendieta, Art Institute of Chicago (2011); and Ana Mendieta in Context: Public and Private Work, De La Cruz Collection, Miami (2012).[citation needed] In 2004 the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., organized Earth Body, Sculpture and Performance, a major retrospective that traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Des Moines Art Center, Iowa, and Miami Art Museum, Florida (2004).[1] In 2017 her work was presented in the retrospective solo show Ana Mendieta / Covered in Time and History at Bildmuseet, Umeå University, Sweden. [50] Mendieta's work features in many major public collections, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Museum of Modern Art in New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Musée d'Art Moderne et Contemporain, Geneva; Tate Collection, London;[51] and the Nasher Sculpture Center.[52][53] Death and controversy[edit] Ana Mendieta died on September 8, 1985, in New York City, after falling from her 34th-floor apartment in Greenwich Village at 300 Mercer Street. She lived there with her husband of eight months, minimalist sculptor Carl Andre, who may have pushed her out the window.[54] She fell 33 stories onto the roof of a deli.[55] Just prior to her death, neighbors heard the couple arguing violently.[37] The neighbors heard Mendieta scream out no and right before her death Andre had scratches all over his face. [56] There were no eyewitnesses to the events that led up to Mendieta's death.[57] A recording of Andre's 911 call showed him saying: \"My wife is an artist, and I'm an artist, and we had a quarrel about the fact that I was more, eh, exposed to the public than she was. And she went to the bedroom, and I went after her, and she went out the window.\"[58] In 1988, Andre was tried for her murder and acquitted for second degree murder.[59] During three years of legal proceedings,[57] Andre's lawyer described Mendieta's death as a possible accident or suicide. The judge found Andre not guilty on grounds of reasonable doubt.[58] The acquittal caused an uproar among feminists in the art world, and remains controversial to this day. In 2010, a symposium called Where Is Ana Mendieta? was held at New York University to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death.[60] In May 2014, the feminist protest group No Wave Performance Task Force staged a protest in front of the Dia Art Foundation's retrospective on Carl Andre.[61] The group deposited piles of animal blood and guts in front of the establishment, with protesters donning transparent tracksuits with \"I Wish Ana Mendieta Was Still Alive\" written on them. In March 2015, the No Wave Performance Task Force and a group of feminist poets from New York City traveled to Beacon, New York, to protest the Andre retrospective at Dia:Beacon, where they cried loudly in the main gallery, made \"siluetas\" in the snow on museum grounds, and stained the snow with paprika, sprinkles, and fake blood.[62] In April 2017, protesters at an Andre retrospective handed out cards at the Geffen Contemporary museum with the statement: \"Carl Andre is at MOCA Geffen. ¿Dónde está Ana Mendieta?\" (Where is Ana Mendieta?). This was followed by an open letter to Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) Director Philippe Vergne protesting the exhibit, from the group the Association of Hysteric Curators.[63] Legacy[edit] Mendieta's death in 1985 came to define her legacy which overshadowed the pioneering of her art. In 2009, Mendieta was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Cintas Foundation.[1]   In 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for her that began, \"Mendieta's art, sometimes violent, often unapologetically feminist and usually raw, left an indelible mark before her life was cut short.\"[64]  In 2010 she was the subject of Richard Move's controversial Where is Ana Mendieta? 25 Years Later - An Exhibition and Symposium, which included his film, BloodWork - The Ana Mendieta Story.

General Rojas was revered in all of Cuba because when he was ordered to burn the sugar mills controlled by the Spanish troops, he burned his own mill, too, destroying all his wealth to save his country. There were many heroes in Ana's family, and great-grandfather Carlos was a disciple of Longfellow who had studied at Harvard, helping the bard practice his Spanish at teatime.\n ^ a b c.\nCabañas, Kaira (1999). \"Ana Mendieta: \"Pain of Cuba, Body I Am\" \".

She lived in foster homes and orphanages for the rest of her childhood. She received her MA in 1972 from the University of Iowa. In the 1970s, she began making 'earth-body sculptures,' employing primitive materials such as blood, earth, fire, and water. She documented her performances, which incorporated aspects of religion and magic, with photographs. In 1983, she went to Rome on an American Academy Fellowship. In 1985, her husband, the Minimalist sculptor Carl Andre, was charged with her death but acquitted.\n Nationalities American, Cuban.\nGender Female.\nRoles Artist, Painter, Performance Artist, Photographer, Sculptor, Video Artist.\nName Ana Mendieta.\nUlan 500052055.\nView the full Getty record.\nInformation from Getty’s Union List of Artist Names ® (ULAN), made available under the ODC Attribution License.\nWorks 29 works online Ana Mendieta Untitled (Facial Cosmetic Variations) January-February, 1972.\nAna Mendieta Untitled (Glass on Body Imprints--face) 1972.\nAna Mendieta Untitled 1978.\nAna Mendieta Untitled (Amategram) c. 1982–83.\nVarious Artists, Carl Andre, Ana Mendieta Pietre Foglie 1984.\nCarl Andre, Ana Mendieta Plate (folio 5) from Pietre Foglie 1984.\nAna Mendieta, Carl Andre Plate (folio 6) from Pietre Foglie 1984.\nCarl Andre, Ana Mendieta Plate (folio 7) from Pietre Foglie 1984.\nAna Mendieta, Carl Andre Plate (folio 8) from Pietre Foglie 1984.\nCarl Andre, Ana Mendieta Plate (folio 9) from Pietre Foglie 1984.\nExhibitions 417: Transparency in Architecture and Beyond Ongoing Collection gallery MoMA.\n203: Art as a Verb Ongoing Collection gallery MoMA.\n206: Transfigura­tions Fall 2019–Fall 2020 Collection gallery MoMA.\nStudio Visit: Selected Gifts from Agnes Gund Apr 29–Jul 22, 2018 MoMA.\nTransmissions: Art in Eastern Europe and Latin America, 1960–1980 Sep 5, 2015–Jan 3, 2016 MoMA.\nContemporary Collection Nov 16, 2011–Feb 9, 2014 MoMA.\nStaging Action: Performance in Photography since 1960 Jan 28–May 9, 2011 MoMA.\nThe Original Copy: Photography of Sculpture, 1839 to Today Aug 1–Nov 1, 2010 MoMA.\nView all 19 exhibitions.\nPublications Our Selves: Photographs by Women Artists Edited by Roxana Marcoci, 2022 Exhibition catalogue, Hardcover, 152 pages.\nMoMA Highlights: 375 Works from The Museum of Modern Art Introduction by Glenn D.

Recommended Contemporary Art Guerrilla Girls, Inc. – 35 Years and Counting.\nArt Forms The Post-Minimalistic and Feminist Art of Lynda Benglis.\nContemporary Art The Feminist Artists Who Changed the World.\n “Where is Ana Mendieta?” was the question shouted in 1992 by over 500 protesters lined in front of the newly opened Guggenheim Museum site in SoHo, New York (closed nowadays). The inaugural show featured the work of five men and one woman, all white, which already sparked anger. Yet the last straw adding to the outrage was that one of the artists included in the show was the Minimalist sculptor Carl Andre. Why would that be? Because many accused Andre of killing his wife and fellow artist, Ana Mendieta. Her death still remains an unresolved mystery, even though the court acquitted Andre in 1988.   The movement   Guerrilla Girls poster. Guerrilla Girls.\n   The protesting crowd in 1992, mobilized by the Guerrilla Girls and the Women’s Action Coalition (WAC), gained momentum and subsequently founded a movement WHEREISANAMENDIETA. The movement has been operating ever since. It opposes the erasure of women, non-binary people, black and minority ethnic people and all others oppressed and marginalized by the system and especially cultural institutions.   Ana’s death should not overshadow her legacy   This is not a photograph of Ana’s corpse. It’s a photographic documentation of her untitled performance from 1973. Galerie Lelong , New York and Paris and Alison Jacques Gallery, London, England.\n   The artist and curator Coco Fusco, who knew Mendieta personally, expressed in an interview her concern:   “All of the post-mortem canonization has nothing to do with how she lived or how she was treated during her life. I think she’s become a symbol used by many people to address sexism in the art world through personal attacks directed at Carl Andre. Many younger artists exploit the memory of Ana for their own professional advancement.”\nCoco Fusco in an interview with Jared Quinton, 2016, Artsy.   Subversive from the beginning   Ana Mendieta, Untitled (Facial Hair Transplant) , 1972, Courtesy of The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, and Galerie Lelong , New York, USA.\n   Already with her first known work, created for her degree at the University of Iowa, Mendieta set a definite direction in which she wanted her art to progress. By gluing the facial hair of her colleague to her own face, she questioned what masculinity/femininity meant, and also she disrupted the social conventions which codified the sexual and gender classifications. Although in 2020 this work might seem naïve and irrelevant, in 1972 it was a very thought-provoking.   Earth-body art   Ana Mendieta, The Tree of Life, 1976, Whitney Museum of Art, New York, USA.\n   All following works were equally subversive, questioning the beauty canons and gender roles. They also raised pressing issues of self-identification and male violence against women. Mendieta focused mostly on performance, using her own body and the surroundings to create artworks. Her “Silueta Series” in which she staged herself in nature, was “a way of reclaiming my roots and becoming one with nature,” as she described. Moreover, she added that:   “My exploration through my art of the relationship between myself and nature has been a clear result of my having been torn from my homeland during my adolescence. (…) Although the culture in which\nI live is part of me, my roots and cultural identity are a result of my Cuban heritage.”\nUnpublished notes by Mendieta, quoted in Charles Merewether, From Inscription to Dissolution: An Essay on Expenditure in the Work of Ana Mendieta, in Coco Fusco, ed.

Cuban refugee   Ana Mendieta, Untitled (Grass on Woman) , 1972, Courtesy of The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, and Galerie Lelong , New York, USA.\n   Ana became a refugee when she was only 12. As part of Operation Peter Pan, during which Cuban parents sent their children to the United States following a rumour that Fidel Castro’s regime would put children in indoctrination centres, Ana and her sister arrived in Iowa. Their father was a political prisoner, which made it impossible for the rest of the family to reach the girls. Once in the States, in the 1970s Ana became involved in El Diálogo, an advocacy effort promoting a rapprochement between Cuba and the United States, which would make possible the family reunification visits for the exiles who were not allowed to ever return back to Cuba. Ten years later, in 1980, Ana set her foot in Cuba again. Here she met artists and began a creative collaboration between her US friends and the Cubans.   Mysterious death   Photograph of Ana Mendieta, Courtesy of The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, and Galerie Lelong , New York, USA.\n   Mendieta’s ritualistic art, which often evoked the occult and the folk traditions of her beloved Mexico (where she often travelled) and of course Cuba, to some seemed a foreshadowing of her own fate. She died at age 36. She fell out of the window of her own flat on the 34th floor on September 8, 1985. Her husband, Carl Andre, when calling the police said that “Ana went out of the window”. The neighbors said they had earlier heard the couple quarrel. However, Andre claimed he remembered nothing and that Mendieta might have committed suicide. Her friends, however, who recalled her acute fear of heights and the successful career she enjoyed at that point, doubted she would have just jumped in her underwear out of depression or despair. On the grounds of insufficient evidence, the court acquitted Andre three years after the tragedy.

The life and the work of Ana Mendieta are inextricably linked. Born in Cuba, 12-year-old Mendieta and her older sister were sent to the United States to escape the turmoil in the wake of the Cuban Revolution. She obtained a degree in painting, multimedia and video art at the University of Iowa, also the site of her first performances between 1972 and 1974, which carried the marks of being wrenched from her family and culture. In Death of a Chicken (1972), the artist, naked, held a newly decapitated chicken by its feet, its death spasms staining its pure white feathers with blood and splattering the body of the performer. This ritual made explicit reference to the animal sacrifices of Latin American culture, as well as emphasizing the identification of the female artist with nature and the animal kingdom. The use of blood recurred throughout the artistic output of Mendieta, particularly in her most famous performance, Body Tracks (1974), where, facing a wall, her raised hands coated with red paint, she let herself slide down to the ground, leaving behind the blurred outlines of her movement. After her tragic death in 1985 (she fell from her apartment window under suspicious conditions, aggravated by the ambiguous role of her husband, the sculptor Carl Andre), Nancy Spero transformed Mendieta’s groundbreaking performance into a political and aesthetic emblem. From 1975 until the end of her life, Mendieta dedicated herself exclusively to works on and in nature. She endeavored to weave, in her own words, a “dialogue between the landscape and the female body” — meaning her own — a dialogue that originated when she was torn from her native country, which she compared to being “cast from the womb (nature).” Her “earth-body” sculptures allowed her to “return to the maternal source and the bonds that unite[d her] to the universe.” For ten years, she traveled the American continent (the United States to Mexico, Havana to Canada), to merge with the landscape, engrave symbols of femininity upon it, burn herself in effigy, wrap herself in flowers, be born into the surf, take root, disappear… All her actions, filmed, photographed, sculpted, drew the contours of a territory and of a body that participated in an existential feminism, doubled by a radical pantheism.

Ana Mendieta in Havana, Cuba, in 1981; Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons 1. Cast from the Womb Mendieta was born into a prominent political family in Havana, Cuba. In 1961, following the Cuban Revolution, Mendieta’s father became a political prisoner for his disloyalty to Fidel Castro, and 12-year-old Mendieta was sent to the United States under Operation Peter Pan. “Having been torn from my homeland during my adolescence, I am overwhelmed by the feeling of having been cast from the womb. My art is the way I reestablish the bonds that unite me to the Universe,” she once said. 2.  Master of Art In the 1970s, as a graduate student in the University of Iowa’s Intermedia program, Mendieta experimented with using her own body as a medium. The artist began creating “earth body works,” in which she incorporated her naked body, or its impression, into natural landscapes. Her well-known “Silueta” series (1973–1980) emerged from this practice. Mendieta fused feminism with Land Art and crossed boundaries of performance, photography, and film. 3. Class is in Session In the early 1970s, Mendieta taught an art class at Henry Sabin Elementary School in Iowa City. During this time, she made artworks using her students as collaborators, filming their actions in response to her prompts. Two of these lesser-known works, Parachute (1973) and Untitled (Soul) (1973) were featured in the 2017–18 exhibition Ana Mendieta: Thinking About Children’s Thinking at the Sugar Hill Children’s Museum of Art & Storytelling in New York City.

Evolving Earth In 1983, Mendieta was awarded a residency at the American Academy in Rome, where her artistic practice continued to evolve. Up until this point, Mendieta worked with natural elements as they occur outdoors. In her new studio space, Mendieta created floor sculptures from soil and sand, importing these elements from locations that held significance for her, including Cuba. Works such as Untitled (Sandwoman Series) (1983–84) echo her “Silueta” series but stand apart. 5. Feminist Family After moving to New York City in the late 1970s, Mendieta became friends with feminist artists including Nancy Spero (1926–2009), Mary Beth Edelson (1933–2021), Barbara Kruger (b. 1945), and Carolee Schneemann (1939–2019); film critic B. Ruby Rich; and Artforum editor Ida Panicelli. After her untimely and suspicious death, when Mendieta’s husband Carl Andre was on trial for her murder (though he was acquitted), many of these women advocated for Mendieta, attending the trial, testifying on her behalf, and ensuring her work continued to be recognized. Today, advocacy groups continue to stage actions in her name.\n About the Author  —Katie Carroll is the summer 2021 digital engagement intern and Alicia Gregory is the assistant editor at the National Museum of Women in the Arts.\n Posted In 5 Fast Facts.\nRelated Posts Feb 17, 2022 5 Fast Facts: Betty Parsons and #5WomenArtists Posted: Feb 17, 2022 in 5 Fast Facts Impress your friends with five fast facts about artist and gallerist Betty Parsons and #5WomenArtists she championed, all of whom have work in NMWA’s collection.\n Blog Category: 5 Fast Facts.\nJan 19, 2022 5 Fast Facts: Käthe Kollwitz Posted: Jan 19, 2022 in 5 Fast Facts Impress your friends with five fast facts about Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945).

{"id": 200, "data": "Ana\nMendieta: Earth Body, Sculpture and Performance 1972-85 One Universal Energy Runs\nThrough Everything Erin Dziedzic  Ana Mendieta: Earth Body,\nSculpture and Performance 1972-85\nsensitively reflects the art, life, and legacy of Ana Mendieta.  This\ncomprehensive traveling exhibition, at the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa from\n25 February to 22 May, 2005, included Mendieta’s early intermedia work, films, Siluetas, Rupestrian Escultures, sculptures and objects.  Iowa marks the location\nwhere Mendieta’s artistic career blossomed.  Born into a Catholic family in\nHavana, Cuba in 1948, Mendieta was sent to the United States with her sister\nRaquelín under the auspice of Operation Pedro Pan,[1] to\nescape Communist rule under Fidel Castro.  Miami, Florida was the first ground\nthe young girls touched in the United States but after a short time they were\nrelocated to Dubuque, Iowa with aid from the Catholic Church.  The rapid\nintersection of Cuban and North American cultures and the pain of exile at such\nan early age greatly affected her artistic development.  Memories of Cuban\nculture remained a constant influence in Mendieta’s art, leaving us with an\nintimate visual diary of how these memories were migrated into an American\ncontext. Mendieta created most of her\nearly ‘earth-body works’ in the creeks and on the land, in and around Cedar\nRapids, Iowa.  Curator, Olga M. Viso, who organized the exhibition of\nMendieta’s art, emphasized the inherent power of her work to evoke the deeply\nphysical and spiritual presence of Mendieta, a potential which Mendieta\nattested to in her own personal writings, “there is nothing as beautiful and\nhumanizing in a work of art than that which sharpens sensibilities and opens\nnew worlds to man.”[2] Upon entering the Des Moines Art\nCenter one is ‘reintroduced’ to Mendieta, an artist whose work made a profound\nimpact on performance/body art of the 1970s, early intermedia art, Latin\nAmerican art, earth-body art, and feminist aesthetics.   Untitled (Glass on Body Imprints), 1972, Photograph. © The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, courtesy Galerie Lelong, New York.\n  Untitled (Glass on Body Imprints), 1972, Photograph. © The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, courtesy Galerie Lelong, New York  The exhibition opens with a\ncollection of photographs, films, and personal artifacts from Mendieta’s years\nas a graduate student at the University of Iowa. Works like 1972 Glass on\nBody Imprints, reveal her budding\ninterest in the newly developing intermedia program implemented into the\nuniversity curriculum by Hans Breder.  Glass on Body Imprints, document, in photographs, a series where Mendieta\npresses a square piece of plexiglass directly onto her face and body, radically\ndistorting her features.  This type of body art, in which the body is a\nsculptural material, was introduced to Mendieta through the Multimedia Program\nand the Center for New Performing Art.[3]  Body art had such a profound impact\non the way Mendieta began to interpret the body as sculpture that by 1973\nMendieta was posing for Breder’s unique photographs of the body as sculpture\nwhich were also displayed, courtesy of Breder, alongside Mendieta’s work.  This\nsupplemental material accompanying Mendieta’s art, included within the same\nspace, reinforces her own interest in the connection between art and life.\nThese unique additions help to facilitate the intimacy already present in the\nspace while giving those who are less familiar with Mendieta’s work the\nopportunity to see the artistic traditions and influences she was working from\nat the time. Mendieta, like many artists\nof her era, took her work out of the studio, with the majority of works\nproduced in the landscape - shaping the earth, digging her hands into it, and\nmanipulating it.  Although, such ephemeral works intended to defy the\nart-market system in a particular kind of way, they were conserved and\nre-articulated through photographs and video, which subsequently formed a\nsignificant part of Mendieta’s art.  This exhibition is not organized as a\ntypical hanging canvas show but rather enhances Mendieta’s own interest in a\nvariety of media.  There is an eclectic mix of\nworks on paper side by side with sculptural works, video and photographs. Mendieta’s personal\nnotebooks were also delicately displayed as an intimate focal point of the\nexhibition, providing a beneficial resource for understanding her creative\nthought processes.  Mendieta described her own art as follows, My\nart is grounded in the belief of one universal energy which runs through\neverything: from insect to man, from man to spectre, from spectre to plant from\nplant to galaxy. My\nworks are the irrigation veins of this universal fluid.  Through them ascend\nthe ancestral sap, the original beliefs, the primordial accumulations, the\nunconscious thoughts that animate the world.[4] The careful organization of\nthis exhibition is receptive to the way Mendieta explained her own art.\nMendieta’s medium evolves over the course of her artistic career but visual\ncomponents like the female body and the use of earth materials remain\nconstants, supplying her oeuvre with universal energy yet receptive to social,\nreligious, political, and feminist concerns.  Where Mendieta explored the female\nbody as a spiritual catalyst for a myriad of social topics, Robert Smithson\nworked directly with the idea of entropy in the site, non-site, and attacked\nthe idea of an art centered on human beings.[5] A major highlight of the\nshow is the inclusion of several of the close to eighty short films that\nMendieta created over a lifetime.  These silent films on Super-8 color, were\nrestored and projected onto white screens that measure about 4’x3’.  Situated\nevenly throughout the gallery they coalesce to generate lucid shifts in\nMendieta’s oeuvre from her student years in Iowa to practicing ‘professional’\nartist after her move to New York in 1978. Untitled (Body Tracks) from 1974 is a compact work, a short one minute and ten seconds,\nwherein Mendieta silently executes a powerful wall drawing.  Mendieta stands\nfacing the wall, both blood-stained hands and forearms raised above her head\nagainst its white surface; she gradually slides down onto her knees, tapering\nthe stained markings from her hands to a place where they meet at the bottom of\nthe wall but never quite converge in on one another.  This recorded action commences when\nMendieta stands, shaking, and turns to address the audience for a brief moment\nbefore exiting the field of view.  By eliminating the ‘paintbrush’ Mendieta is\nable to use her own body to control her desired outcome rather than relying on\nan objectification of the male gaze as dictator to the female body.  Quite\nunlike Yves Klein’s anthropometric painting from the 1950s where naked females\npainted with their bodies under the instruction of Klein’s own male ego,\nMendieta became both the instructor and participant in the gesture of her own\nfemale form.  Untitled (Body\nTracks) is a vivid and compelling\nforeshadowing to Mendieta’s unified body of work.  \\ Untitled (Body Tracks), 197435mm-slide documentation of a performance with blood and cloth also documented as Super-8 color, silent film © The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, courtesy Galerie Lelong, New York.\nMendieta was intensely\ninvolved in Hans Breder’s intermedia program by the early 1970s and aware of\nbody performance artists like Vito Acconci, Hannah Wilke and Carolee Schneeman,\nbut distanced herself from their often specifically psychological aesthetic,\nconcentrated, for the most part, in the urban environment.[6] Many of\nMendieta’s works were executed out in the woods or by secluded streams and had\nstrong spiritual relationship to the landscape, while Adrian Piper, for\nexample, took to the streets of New York with an agenda of objectifying herself\nin order to politicize the social conventions of “otherness.”  They both\nconcentrated on non-art spaces but developed completely different body\naesthetics.  In early filmed performances Mendieta’s connection to spiritual\nelements, violence, and feminism stemmed from rapes that were occurring at the\nUniversity of Iowa campus.  Later, Mendieta’s body was still a major component\nof her short films but she expanded on a dialogue between body and earth, eros\nand life/death, and the aesthetic of physical and conceptual spirituality.\nMendieta accomplished this not only by using video as an ephemeral component\nbut by using materials like gunpowder, fire, grass, and dirt to lessen the idea\nof preservation as a means to experiencing her work. The Siluetas (silhouettes) are Mendieta’s most recognized works due in part to the\nrecent inclusion of Imagen de Yagul (Image from Yagul), 1973 in Survey texts like Gardner’s marking the\nparadigmatic beginning of Mendieta’s impactful Silueta Series.[7]  It is one of the smaller works\nrepresented in the exhibition but it clearly marks a formative transition in\nMendieta’s art which leads to a more solid focus on the female body and the\nearth which rests outside of an urban social context.  This work is a\nphotograph taken of Mendieta lying nude in a pre-Hispanic tomb, at the\nMesoamerican site of Yagul, covered in a spray of white flowers.  Variations on\nthe Siluetas developed over time\nas Mendieta wrapped her body in a white sheet for Untitled, 1975 at Cuilapan Church in Oaxaca, Mexico, allowing\nthe ghostly form of her contorted figure to protrude from the tightly pulled\nfabric.  Imagen de Yagul, 1973 Lifetime color photograph © The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, courtesy Galerie Lelong, New York Mendieta’s silhouettes\nstand frozen in time by photographs yet this trace element allows the viewer to\nget a sense of the performative element which is another constant in Mendieta’s\nart.  The body is suggested in later Siluetas by carving away or adding natural materials and is\noften enhanced by fire, grasses, flowers, gunpowder, sticks and other natural\nmaterials.  Atabey (Mother of the Waters), 1981 Photo-etching on chine colle © The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, courtesy Galerie Lelong, New York The Silueta Series gave way to Mendieta’s Rupestrian Escultures.  This series of silhouettes were carved into\nremotes caves on the outskirts of Havana, Cuba.  These simple human-like forms\ntake on a position of monumentality through the medium of photography,\npowerfully dissociating one from their current context and taking viewers to an\nancient culture. The Rupestrian Escultures are exhibited as massive photographs and smaller photo etchings, which\nMendieta had intended on compiling into a book format.  These images reside in\na central area of the gallery and establish nice shift into Mendieta’s later\nwork where she begins to explore the Silueta as a free-standing sculpture.  Untitled (Totem Grove Series), 1984-85 Series of four sculptures of wood and gunpowder© The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, courtesy Galerie Lelong, New York.\nThe Totem Grove Series are some of Mendieta’s final works.  Using gunpowder\nMendieta burned dark shadowy silhouettes into the surfaces of the tree trunks.\nOn some the nubs and lump are left on the trunks to accentuate female genitals\nand breasts.  They are thoughtfully grouped together in a configuration similar\nto how they were arranged in her studio in Rome, Italy.  Since these works were\nnot previously exhibited it is unclear if Mendieta had intended the sculptures\nto be seen independently or as a group.  The Totem Grove Series was a big step in Mendieta’s career; she was\nunaccustomed to working in a studio space, making us wonder what direction the\nsilhouette would have taken. Though we will never know\nwhat would have followed in Mendieta’s oeuvre, we can agree that her art\nexplored multi-media to its fullest, creating an intertextual exploration of\nlife, art and the body coupled with ancient religious imagery and the ‘memory\nof history.’  This exhibition sustains the belief Mendieta’s art has one\nuniversal energy running through everything.  Ana Mendieta: Earth Body,\nSculpture and Performance 1972-85 is\nan accomplished success which brings people closer to Mendieta’s persistent\nsearch for origin.  Along the way the spiritual legacy of Mendieta’s art\nrefuels our very own search for origins. Erin Dziedzic is an M.A.\ncandidate in the Savannah College of Art and Design’s Art History Department.

His unique compositional strategies result in dramatic images that walk the line between representation and abstraction. Gursky, the son and grandson of commercial photographers, grew up in Düsseldorf, West Germany. During the late 1970s he studied photography in Essen at the Folkwang Academy (now part of the multicampus Folkwang University of the Arts). He then became a student of Bernd and Hilla Becher at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf (1981–87). There he started, like the majority of his peers, photographing in black and white with a handheld Leica camera, but he quickly went against trend and began working in colour with a larger 4 × 5-inch (10.2 × 12.7-cm) camera on a tripod. Despite his preference for working in colour, Gursky’s flat, dispassionate documentary style placed him squarely within the Düsseldorf school of photography, alongside Thomas Ruff, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth, all of whom studied under the Bechers. Gursky’s subject matter during the 1980s ranged from office-building security guards behind their desks to vast panoramas in which small figures engage in leisure activities to landscapes of the Ruhr River valley. Ratingen Swimming Pool (1987) shows a lush green landscape dotted with tiny figures swimming and relaxing by the pool. The scene was photographed from a considerable distance at a slightly elevated perspective. Though shot far from the pool, the image captures every element of the scene with extreme clarity and focus. Gursky’s thoroughgoing attention to detail in every part of the composition is a style for which he became known and celebrated. By the late 1980s Gursky was producing photographs so large that they could be printed only in a commercial lab; within a few years he was printing on the largest photo paper available, and still later he was combining the largest single sheets to make his images even larger. Gursky was the first to produce prints that measured as large as 6  × 8 feet (1.8  × 2.4 metres) or larger. An example of that scale is his Paris, Montparnasse (1993)—a panoramic image of a large high-density apartment building that stands 7 feet high × 13 feet wide (about 2.1 × 4 metres). The head-on, slightly elevated perspective captures the building, some sky, and some ground, offering the viewer an entry point into the scene. However, by not including the side edges of the building within the frame of the photograph, Gursky made the structure look infinitely wide, with thousands of inhabitants living in close quarters but—with no visible interaction and the endless repetition of walls between apartments—seemingly isolated and alienated from one another. Paris, Montparnasse is an example of Gursky’s use of formal compositional strategies to comment on and construct narratives related to the realities of contemporary urban life. Paris, Montparnasse also exemplifies Gursky’s early attempts at digital manipulation, with which he began to experiment in 1992. His process involved shooting chromogenic prints (or “c-prints”) with film, using a large-format 5 × 7-inch (12.7 × 17.8-cm) camera; he scanned the images and digitally retouched and manipulated them on a computer. In Rhein II (1999)—which is 5 × 10 feet (about 1.5 × 3 metres)—Gursky created a nonexistent section of the Rhine River. By joining photographs of different segments of the river, Gursky invented an entirely new landscape, free of industry and human presence. Like a colour-field painting, the photograph is a composition of stunning colour and precise geometry. In 2011 Rhein II became the most expensive photograph sold at auction, going for more than $4.3 million.  Perhaps his most-recognizable images are a group of aerial shots of whirling activity on the trading floor of the Chicago Board of Trade (1999). Those images burst with colour, movement, and a striking amount of detail that covers every inch of the massive photograph. With its repetition of gestures and spots of intense colour, the lack of a distinct focal point, and the implication of the scene going on infinitely outside the frame of the photograph, Gursky achieved the effect of an all-over painting—a composition with no single focal point and in which paint reaches to all edges of the canvas—as in works from the late 1940s and early 1950s by Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Gursky’s images of big concerts, such as Madonna I (2001) and Cocoon II (2008) are other examples of that effect. In order to achieve flatness and a compressed depth of field, Gursky sometimes employed helicopters or cranes that allowed him to shoot from above and thus to avoid a traditional one-point perspective. Gursky also often manipulated colour in order to achieve a more organized or homogenous palette, such as in 99 Cent II Diptychon (2001), a dizzying diptych shot in a 99 Cents Only store. He manipulated the colour to create an explosion of repeating reds, yellows, and oranges dotted with blue, pink, white, and black. He also digitally inserted a reflection of the merchandise onto the ceiling, adding to the overwhelming visual effect and to the sensation of being surrounded by consumer culture gone mad. In the mid-2000s Gursky often worked in Asia—chiefly in Japan, Thailand, North Korea, and China. His series Pyongyang, shot in 2007 in North Korea, documented the Arirang Festival—a sporadically held weeks-long annual event, named for a Korean folk song, that in 2007 involved 80,000 participants in highly choreographed gymnastic performances honouring the late founder of North Korea, Kim Il-Sung.  Gursky photographed the festivities from an enormous distance, rendering the spectacle of tens of thousands of acrobats and performers a flat carpet of colour and frozen gestures. In 2011 in Bangkok he created a series that captured the Chao Phraya River from above. His focus on reflection, currents, and the play of light and shadow on the flowing river resulted in images that look alternately like abstract paintings and satellite photographs. Gursky also returned to printing and exhibiting much smaller photographs as a way to experiment with perception and reception, as in the exhibition “Werke/Works 80–08” at the Vancouver Art Gallery (2009). Aside from wanting to be able to exhibit more works in less room, he had been exhibiting works on a monumental scale for nearly two decades and chose to introduce small prints again in order to understand the impact of scale on the viewer’s visual experience. Gursky fundamentally redefined photography for a new generation of artists. His unabashed use of digital manipulation forced into debate a new version of the age-old question of truth in photography, a discussion that began as early as the 1860s when it became apparent that the truth-recording capabilities of the camera could be manipulated, thereby distorting reality and eroding the viewer’s trust. Gursky’s approach pushed critics and artists to consider whether the question of truth, with the prevalence of digital photography and digital processing, was even relevant to the discussion anymore.\n Naomi Blumberg \n", "label": [[109, 125, "DATE"], [135, 150, "GPE"], [168, 188, "WORK_OF_ART"], [191, 210, "WORK_OF_ART"], [213, 222, "WORK_OF_ART"], [225, 233, "WORK_OF_ART"], [263, 277, "ARTIST"], [286, 302, "DATE"], [304, 325, "GPE"], [597, 603, "ARTIST"], [666, 690, "GPE"], [708, 713, "DATE"], [740, 745, "GPE"], [861, 883, "ARTIST"], [891, 915, "GALLERY"], [919, 929, "GPE"], [931, 938, "DATE"], [1224, 1230, "ARTIST"], [1302, 1312, "GPE"], [1346, 1357, "ARTIST"], [1359, 1372, "ARTIST"], [1378, 1391, "ARTIST"], [1423, 1430, "ARTIST"], [1432, 1438, "ARTIST"], [1467, 1472, "DATE"], [1646, 1668, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1670, 1674, "DATE"], [1966, 1972, "ARTIST"], [2107, 2112, "DATE"], [2113, 2119, "ARTIST"], [2221, 2226, "DATE"], [2372, 2378, "ARTIST"], [2512, 2531, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2533, 2537, "DATE"], [2900, 2906, "ARTIST"], [3141, 3160, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3178, 3184, "ARTIST"], [3318, 3337, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3355, 3361, "ARTIST"], [3441, 3445, "DATE"], [3665, 3673, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3675, 3679, "DATE"], [3725, 3731, "ARTIST"], [3841, 3847, "ARTIST"], [4027, 4031, "DATE"], [4032, 4040, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4115, 4127, "MONEY"], [4240, 4266, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4268, 4272, "DATE"], [4586, 4592, "ARTIST"], [4758, 4763, "DATE"], [4774, 4779, "DATE"], [4823, 4829, "ARTIST"], [4864, 4873, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4875, 4879, "DATE"], [4885, 4894, "WORK_OF_ART"], [4896, 4900, "DATE"], [4999, 5005, "ARTIST"], [5139, 5145, "ARTIST"], [5247, 5267, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5269, 5273, "DATE"], [5305, 5313, "MONEY"], [5657, 5662, "DATE"], [5663, 5669, "ARTIST"], [5686, 5690, "GPE"], [5702, 5707, "GPE"], [5709, 5717, "GPE"], [5719, 5730, "GPE"], [5736, 5741, "GPE"], [5754, 5763, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5773, 5777, "DATE"], [5781, 5792, "GPE"], [5809, 5825, "EVENT"], [5909, 5913, "DATE"], [6020, 6031, "GPE"], [6047, 6053, "ARTIST"], [6230, 6234, "DATE"], [6238, 6245, "GPE"], [6495, 6501, "ARTIST"], [6644, 6661, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6670, 6691, "GALLERY"], [6693, 6697, "DATE"], [6828, 6839, "DATE"], [6960, 6966, "ARTIST"], [7200, 7205, "DATE"], [7363, 7369, "ARTIST"]]}

Living and working in Düsseldorf, Germany, he represents a revaluation of realism within contemporary photography through conceptual staging and digital image editing. The German photographer popularised photography focusing on day to day human activities in commerce, sports, leisure and others. His trademark photos show large formats of stock exchanges, ports, concert arenas, race tracks and other areas that hold human activity. The point of angle is usually elevated to take in as much area as possible. Early life & influences Gursky studied photography at the Folkwang Academy in Essen during the 1970s. He started experimenting with a 4×5 inch (10.2×12.7 cm) camera, which was at odds with the photography of these days. His early work was initially strongly influenced by the Becher aesthetic. Later, his style became known as uniquely ‘Gursky’ as he slowly shifted away from their philosophies and produced large-format color photographs with unreal documentation of details. His work matured quickly in the 1990s after he started to focus on scenes and places depicting the international sentiment of modern society. He was later known for employing excessive detail in his work, as can be seen in his photographs like the May Day series and 99 Cent. Today, his photographs continue to represent scenes occurring in instant recognizable urban settings and heavily computer-rendered images.Andreas Gursky – May Day IV, 2000 Gursky pushed large format photography to new heights. By the 1980s, he was printing on commercial photography paper using the largest print paper available. He combined print papers to make the photos even larger. He was the first photographer to produce prints larger than 6×8 feet (1.8×2.4 m). Recurring topics The spectrum of Gursky’s work includes topics such as architecture, landscape, interiors, as well as large events with huge crowds such as The Mass Games of North Korea or his famed series of photos of stock exchanges throughout the world. By doing that, he covers aspects of modern life in work, business, and social life.Andreas Gursky – Pyongyang II, Diptychon, 2007 In his own words It is not pure photography, what I do. All my pictures are based on a direct visual experience from which I develop an idea for a picture, which is subjected to testing in the studio and eventually worked on and precised at the computer. Selected works 99 cent, 2001 99 Cent represents the quintessential Andreas Gursky photograph. The image comprises several pictures of products taken in a 99 Cents Only Store in Los Angeles and then stitched together to form a single large-size digital image. Another thing that cannot be missed is the heads of shoppers going about their businesses looking for what they need. While the photograph shows us what we see every day in retail stores, it shows us what we don’t see every day. When we visit a supermarket, we don’t get an opportunity to take in what we see in the 99 Cents photograph. Instead, we are always in a hurry to pick what we want and leave the store, just as the busy heads of shoppers can be seen floating anonymously above the products. 99 cent has a deeper meaning than just an image of a common store. Gursky tries to show the audience what they are up against. This, to him, is the world that we have created ourselves, yet we are ignoring it. Despite its somewhat rigid composition, the photograph, with its amount of unending detail, is a visual assault. 99 cent is one of the most expensive modern photographs ever sold.Andreas Gursky – 99 Cent I, 2001 Amazon, 2016 Amazon (2016) indicates just how talented Andreas Gursky is by turning an Amazon depot into art. Gursky wanted to photograph a high-rack room packed with books at a warehouse in Phoenix, Arizona, before the idea of taking pictures of the Amazon distribution center came to mind. At first, the warehouse’s security could not allow him to use the truck he needed, but eventually, the company’s CEO, Jeff Bezos, was convinced. Amazon, 13 feet long and 8 feet tall, is a single large-scale image showing unrecognizable patterns of modern mass consumption and the distribution of goods. The artist managed again to observe detail in taking this picture as everything is equally in focus. The rows of products invoke the elements of the art of the 19th and 20th centuries, including geometric and pointillism. Amazon is very different from the previous work 99 Cent, though they are all pictures of the same things. In 99 Cent, we are introduced to something we are familiar with, while in Amazon, we are looking at an unfamiliar space.Andreas Gursky – Amazon, 2016 Formula 1, 2007 In the four Formula 1 series, Gursky captured busy mechanics and technicians in bold team colors surrounding Formula 1 vehicles in the pit stop, above which spectators are staring down. The photographs are one of the few in which the artist used Photoshop to reorganize the fragments of the picture. The series, created in 2007, focuses on the frenetic activities at the Formula 1 pit stops, capturing the crucial moments that could influence the driver’s career. On a glance, one may think that the spectators in both images are identical. However, when looking keenly, it can be seen that the appearance of the figures varies, especially in terms of color. The four-image series is not a single image like the 99 Cents and Amazon but slightly manipulated photography comprising elements from Formula 1 races worldwide, including Sao Paulo, Monte Carlo, Shanghai, and Istanbul. While the pit stop activities usually take place within only twelve seconds, Gursky portrays the figures in the images in great detail. There is no element of motion as though he had asked them to pose for a shot in the middle of a Formula One track ballet. One thing that viewers might miss in Formula 1 is the inclusion of an attractive grid girl placed directly in the middle of the photograph. One distracted racing team member turns to stare, oblivious to the activities behind him. While the humor can easily be missed, Gursky tries to make it less obvious to the viewer’s eyes. The photos are enticing, making it easy to ingest every emphasized detail. The artist uses contrast to achieve the hypnotic effect. Measuring a whopping 222 centimeters by 608 centimeters, Formula 1 is the largest photograph by Gursky to date.Andreas Gursky – F1 Boxenstopp I, 2007Andreas Gursky – F1 Boxenstopp II, 2007Andreas Gursky – F1 Boxenstopp III, 2007Andreas Gursky – F1 Boxenstopp IV, 2007 Bahrain, 2005 Bahrain 1 is a photograph of a Formula 1 circuit taken in 2004 but created in 2005. The racetrack was from the annual Formula 1 race completed in 2004, and Gursky took the shot from a helicopter. He eventually manipulated the photo, as he did in Formula 1, using Photoshop. Bahrain 1 shows a snaky Grand Prix Circuit making its way through the desert landscape. Black tarmac tracks form a strong dissimilarity with the light brown desert sand surrounding them. There are no single figures shown, cars or people, in the image, although beyond the racetrack, one can notice a long straight grandstand with a white roof. In Bahrain 1, Gursky reinterprets the landscape by reversing the typical sky to land ratio. The landscape is stretched up towards the plane of the picture, leaving just the uppermost portion of the entire photograph for the sky. The flatness and of the opaque racetrack and the desert landscape allows for completely no gradation in the tone. The result is a composition that is quite amazingly painterly. The spinning forms of the circuit appear to be calligraphic brushstrokes of black paint on a blank canvas. But when one views it closely, they will see the defining features of the racetrack. Just like most of Gursky’s works, in Bahrain 1 he represents the human presence within the natural setting in an optically compelling way.Andreas Gursky – Bahrain I, 2005 Rhine II, 1999 In this photo, Gursky combined large-scale photography and digital manipulation to create an entirely new section of the River Rheine. It is a 5 x 10 feet (1.5 x 3 meter) photo that shows a high color landscape free of human presence and industry. Gursky achieved this by combining several sections of the river. This photo became the most expensive ever sold at an auction, fetching $4.3 million in 2011. Rhine II is a photograph of the Lower Rhine River that flows from Bonn German to Hoek van Holland. In the photograph, the river flows straight across the field of view, through flat green fields and under a cloudy sky. The artist removed irrelevant details such as factory building and dog walkers, using digital software.\nGursky said of Rhine II, “Paradoxically, this view of Rhine cannot be obtained in situ, a fictitious construction was required to provide an accurate image of a modern river.”\nIn 2011, the Rhine II fetched £2.7 million at an auction, making it the most expensive photograph ever.\nCommentator Florence Waters has described the art as a “vibrant, beautiful and memorable – I should say unforgettable – contemporary twist on the romantic landscape,” and by Maev Kennedy as “a sludgy image of the grey Rhine under grey skies.”Andreas Gursky – Rhein II, 1999 Kamiokande, 2007 Kamiokande was taken in 2007 under Mount Kamioka in Japan. It is a supernatural photo of the neutrino observatory that aids the Super-Kamioka Neutrino Detection Experiment. The whole photograph comprises thousands of shining gold spheres that create the walls of the space. The orbs attract lights on their surfaces from the above. It then reflects it onto the surface of the obscure water that forms the floor of the observatory. In the bottom right-hand of the photograph are minuscule figures in sterile lab outfits standing in hygienic inflatable rafts. After taking the photograph, Gursky simulated it with digital editing to exaggerate the photo and make viewers see just how jaw-dropping and striking the photo location is. The shot presents a brilliant balance of reflection between the mirror-like water surface and the shiny metallic orbs. In creating this work, Gursky complied with the traditional landscape rules using an utterly untraditional subject. The themes in Kamiokande are similar to the 17th-century paintings by Dutch artists and contemporary works by Ansel Adams. However, Gursky has included an endless stretch of polished artificial orbs and a stripe of water. In this case, humans manipulate nature, as is the case with the real Kamiokande. This goes against the conventional theme of the authority of nature over man. Kamiokande shares some similarities with Andy Warhol’s work in the sense that it also employs the use of repetition and simplicity. Another resemblance with Andy Warhol is that Gursky also believes that art is absolutely everywhere and in everything. The exact use of the real observatory is unknown to many, Gursky managed to present the space with an awe-inspiring optical allure that immediately renders the question moot.Andreas Gursky – Kamiokande, 2007 Atlanta, 1996 Atlanta is another manipulated photo, like other works by Gursky. In this photograph, he has employed digital tools to merge two dissimilar viewpoints of the hotel designed by John-Portman. The image comprises shots taken at the Atlanta Hyatt Regency’s lobby. They are made from the same vantage point but at 180 degrees from one another. Gursky fused the opposite ends of the same vestibules, creating a back wall that was never there. Just like Bahrain I, Atlanta also looks like an abstract painting. On a thematic level, this work is pretty much like the majority of Gursky’s works. This photograph visualizes a world of global migration and flow. A space in which leisure, labor, and travel are evenly interrelated, while humans seem to be channeled as though they were materials being processed inside a giant machine. Although the photo appears cool and deadpan, the photograph seems gloomy in the sense of its formal qualities. Atlanta is perhaps one of the strangest works made by Gursky. Superficially, it appears interactive like most of his works, but when one looks at it for some time, they might begin to mistrust their own perception. The viewer can understand that the landscape represented in the image is unnatural. Whatever reality it tries to express, what the viewer sees is a completely different world from what existed before the lenses of the artist. When the audience notices the digital manipulation of the image, the view becomes even cannier. What is in front becomes physically impossible because it comprises more than twice the standard of human vision range. But, still, it appears similar to our normal field of view. In Atlanta, the reality is rendered both strange and familiar. Therefore, despite its detail and clarity, the photograph does not focus on its documentary features. Instead, it emphasizes its digital manipulation, sowing seeds of doubt about its true nature and the viewer’s ability to understand the objective world.Andreas Gursky – Atlanta, 1996 Montparnasse, Paris, 1993 Paris, Montparnasse is an epic urban panorama and one of the most definitive and spectacular works by Andreas Gursky. The piece once again displays the artistic credentials of Gursky in the photography medium. It is not the first time Paris allures artists, as many before Gursky also fell in love with the city. Gursky started taking shots of the City of Lights in the early 1990s, drawing inspirations from the architectural design of the Immeuble d’habitation Maine-Montparnasse II. The building was designed by architect Jean Dubuisson and built between 1959 and 1964. The structure consists of 750 apartments that accommodate up to 2,000 residents, making it the single-largest residential structure in Paris. Paris, Montparnasse is the first image of all of Gursky’s creations in which he used digital manipulation. He would go on to use this practice repeatedly in some of his works, including , Bahrain 1, and Atlanta. The artist was quoted saying: “Since 1992 I have consciously made use of the possibilities offered by electronic picture processing to emphasize formal elements that will enhance the picture or, for example, to apply a picture concept that in real terms perspective would be impossible to realize.” The photograph is an elevated view of a high-density apartment building in Paris. The dimensions of the print are 7 x 13 feet (2.1 x 4 meters), creating a panoramic effect that captures the ground, building, and sky. The interesting thing is that Gursky did not capture the edges of the building. The overall effect is one of isolation and alienation of the inhabitants of the high-rise, which is a paradox.Andreas Gursky – Paris, Montparnasse, 1993, C-print, 187 × 427.8 × 6.2 cm Photos 1980s Gasherd, 1980Andreas Gursky – Pförtner, Passkontrolle, 1982Andreas Gursky – Pförtner, 1982Andreas Gursky – Düsseldorf, Rhein, 1985Andreas Gursky – Swimming Pool, Ratingen, 1987Andreas Gursky – Teneriffa, 1987Andreas Gursky – Giordano Bruno, 1989Andreas Gursky – Hühner Krefeld, 1989Andreas Gursky – Maloja, 1989Andreas Gursky – Ofenpass, 1989 1990s Andreas Gursky – Hechingen, Jockey , 1990.\nAndreas Gursky – Salerno 1 , 1990.\nGursky says the four shots of the Salerno port in Naples were done by whim. The warm sunlight invited him to shoot a few photos. Interestingly, there were no people in the photos, only numerous new cars, shipping containers, berthed ships and the background of the sea. He says this was the turning point at which he discovered the powerful effect of shooting great scale and sharp accuracy.Andreas Gursky – Genoa, 1991Andreas Gursky – Aletschgletscher, 1993Andreas Gursky – Mercedes, Rastatt, 1993Andreas Gursky – Schiphol, 1994Andreas Gursky – Sha Tin, 1994Andreas Gursky – Centre Georges Pompidou, 1995Andreas Gursky – Dance Valley, 1995Andreas Gursky – Engadin I, 1995Andreas Gursky – Prada II, 1997Andreas Gursky – Zurich V, 1997Andreas Gursky – Chicago Board of Trade II, 1999In this photo, Gursky captures the frenetic activity of the Chicago Board of Trade perfectly but without any point of focus. There are movement and detail all over the photograph, which also creates a feeling of more activity outside the photo.

The Vancouver Art Gallery will be the only North American museum to present Andreas Gursky: Werke/Works 80-08 the largest and most comprehensive exhibition to survey this renowned German artist’s remarkable career. Selected by Gursky himself from his substantial collection of photographic work, this landmark exhibition of more than 130 artworks will be on view from May 30 to September 20, 2009. “It is a privilege for the Gallery to be the only North American museum presenting this extraordinary survey of Andreas Gursky’s photographs. Bringing the work of this internationally renowned contemporary artist to Vancouver would not have been possible without the partnership of our co-organizers the Kunstmuseen in Krefeld, Germany and the Moderna Museet, in Stockholm, Sweden,” said Vancouver Art Gallery director, Kathleen Bartels. “The Gallery puts great emphasis on collaborating with other visual arts institutions to present the work of today’s most important artists.” Gursky’s towering ambition is to create an image-based “Encyclopedia of Life.” Colossal German raves, crammed international trading floors, obsessively-choreographed North Korean political rallies, high tech production lines, multi-acre garbage heaps, rudimentary factory floors, cavernous ultramodern buildings, massive plots of land transformed by agriculture, kilometres of sunbathers on an Italian beachfront, solitary individuals in the midst of mountains, discount stores and prize fights — Gursky captures countless settings, often emphasizing the individual human’s insignificance relative to the built and natural environment. For the artist, photography is not a neutral tool of representation, but a medium for constructing reality. Highly detailed and massive in scope, Gursky creates images that often emphasize human-constructed patterns in urban, rural and remote landscapes to create compositions that are simultaneously representative and abstract. For the first time in many years, Gursky will reduce the scale of his photographs to the panel picture format that launched his career. This method of presentation is a radical departure for Gursky. The artist has recently completed three major museum exhibitions that have featured a small selection of his images at the massive scale for which he has become renowned. Reprinting his images in the panel format allows him the ability to present three decades of work in one comprehensive exhibition for the first time. Andreas Gursky: Werke/Works 80-08 will provide an important opportunity to see how the meaning of the artist’s photographs shifts with the change in presentation, and will offer an occasion for reflection at a critical stage in the artist’s career. Andreas Gursky: Werke/Works 80-08 begins with photographs from the artist’s student days studying under Otto Steinert and influential documentary photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher, and concludes with seven new images printed in the monumental size for which he is best known. This massive selection of images depicts Gursky’s progression, from early photographs based in the documentary tradition to his first experiments with digital technologies and his eventual fine tuning of the process to highlight the fabricated nature of the photographic image. Presented in a chronological chain, the exhibition offers an unprecedented opportunity to witness the evolution of Gursky’s subject matter, aesthetic sensibilities and conceptual strategies. Werke/Works 80-08 is co-organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Kunstmuseen in Krefeld, Germany and the Moderna Museet, in Stockholm, Sweden and is curated by Kunstmuseen director Dr. Martin Hentschel.

{"id": 224, "data": "Homepage Artists.\nAndreas Gursky.\nAndreas Gursky: Chicago Board of Trade I, 1997, Detail. ©Andreas Gursky, VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2021 Works in the Collection People are hardly ever portrayed in Andreas Gursky’s work from the beginning of his career to the present day. Instead, they can sometimes be spotted, in isolation, as singular symbols, amid a stunning natural landscape. With other subject matter, people appear just as infrequently, let alone with their own individual features. Rather, they are merely seen in small, medium or large groups: as a pair of passers-by in a suburb, under a highway bridge in the middle of nowhere, distinct but tiny behind countless windows of a vast apartment block, in the thronging audience at concerts, as the minuscule part of a crowd in trading places, or loosely scattered in leisure settings. But even though people barely feature in Gursky’s pictures, they are always implied. Therefore, anchoring the world as a ‘made’ habitat between the poles of nature and civilization is an elementary dimension of Gursky’s creative output. Aspects of both the factually documentary and structurally typological work of his tutors Michael Schmidt and Bernd Becher are incorporated here: in West Berlin in the early 1980s, when Andreas Gursky studied under him at the Folkwang school, Michael Schmidt was one of the few photographers who portrayed the urban nature of the city – with its vacant lots, backyards, firewalls, and brick walls, in black and white, between somber and sculptural, always in an objective way. By contrast, with Bernd Becher at the academy in Düsseldorf, the subject of architecture conveyed a typologically-oriented image concept that predominantly depicts industrial buildings and production facilities (shaft towers, blast furnaces, silos), also in black and white, in a structurally analytical way and often in serially clustered groups. Unlike his tutors, already at an early stage, Andreas Gursky used color photography in order to deploy it strategically in his pictorial works, in keeping with the apparent truthfulness of photography. By using a large-format camera with sheet film that allows a very deep focus with highly precise detail and no distortion of perspectives for the resulting picture, Gursky always restricts or reinforces the emotional impact that a color photo always conveys, an element that it shares with painting. Over the centuries, much has been written in art theory about the emotional effects that pictures can and are meant to stir in those who view them, and this also frames Andreas Gursky’s work as a reservoir of possibilities. In particular, the influential essays published from the 18th century onwards by writers, theorists, and artists, including the empirical and sensualist aesthetics of Edmund Burke, enhance possible strategies for composing pictures and their intended effect on those who view them with terms regarding “sublime”, “beautiful” or “picturesque” image effects.\n Andreas Gursky: Ratingen, Schwimmbad, 1987. ©Andreas Gursky/Courtesy Sprüth Magers/VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2021 In the axially oriented grid of the image composition of \"Ratingen, Schwimmbad\" (1987), several visitors are scattered in and around a pool under a light-gray sky. The overhead shot makes clear how the polygonal pool is cut into the typical setting of an English landscape garden in order to create an oasis of relaxation, in line with notions of an experiential aesthetic. As a result of the attained visibility, the bathers additionally enliven the entire setting as pictorial, dabbed spots of paint, and convey the pleasantly picturesque impression of a hitherto peaceful afternoon. However, the extremely sharp detail of the photo induces a materially dissecting analysis of the situation, something that the naked eye could not attain. The picture, which simultaneously provides both a micro and macro perspective, thus establishes a curious reference to the world as an entity that it is no longer real to life, but purely technological. Technologically motivated ‘unease’ is also at the fore in Andreas Gursky’s nature shots, such as his work \"Aletschgletscher” from 1993. The largest glacier in the Alps looks more than imposing, with dramatic weather and lighting effects, with bright sections in the center of the photo that dissipate towards the sky and are framed by the darker slopes at the sides. Here, Gursky reverts to those features that carry a sensual and majestic impact, as the viewer is confronted by the large, imposing, raw, and powerful glacier. Yet here too, the highly sharp detail undermines the pure impression of the aesthetically sublime.\n Andreas Gursky: Aletschgletscher, 1993. ©Andreas Gursky/Corutesy Sprüth Magers/VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2021 From 1993 onwards, with the possibilities of digital image processing, Andreas Gursky increasingly presents the photographically composed color photo as an aesthetically condensed fiction. One of his early and most prominent works entitled \"Montparnasse\" depicts the largest residential building in Paris in its entirety, in all its frontal monumentality, but is a montage of two individual photos. Since then, from the viewer's perspective, rather than being solely the result of a technically driven analysis of reality, the conception of the world in Gursky’s pictures is elevated to an encounter with “mega-signs”. As a result of digital image processing, the work “Chicago Board of Trade I” also constitutes a compressed snapshot of human civilization, as a manifestation of its productivity, its frenzy, through its architectural settings and the associated models of economics and society. With the absolute desire for organization, structure, and efficiency, the lust for action and the ensuing yearning for places of retreat and relaxation, the pursuit of civilization changes the shape of the world. In Andreas Gursky’s work, the civilizing power of humankind is reflected in its global context, too.

It was opened at a cost of $1.5 million[1] on June 17, 1926, in a ceremony attended by 2,000.[2] Named for the artist Andy Warhol, a Pittsburgh native, it is one of three parallel bridges called The Three Sisters, the others being the Roberto Clemente Bridge and the Rachel Carson Bridge. The Three Sisters are self-anchored suspension bridges and are historically significant because they are the only trio of nearly identical bridges – as well as the first self-anchored suspension spans — built in the United States. The bridge was renamed for Warhol on March 18, 2005, as part of the tenth-anniversary celebration for the Andy Warhol Museum. Like the 8th Street bridge, few know about the name change and most still call it the 8th street bridge.[citation needed] The museum is nearby at 117 Sandusky Street, a street which leads to the bridge from the north side of the river on Pittsburgh's North Shore. On August 11, 2013, the Andy Warhol Bridge was covered with 580 knitted and crocheted panels in a yarn bombing project known as Knit the Bridge that lasted for four weeks.[3] Duquesne Wharf c. 1912, showing the second Seventh Street Bridge.\nThis is the third bridge on the site, the first having been demolished in early 1884. Construction of its replacement began in 1884,[4] opening to traffic in 1887.[5] Contents 1 Gallery.\n2 See also.\n3 References.\n4 External links.\nGallery[edit] Western side of the bridge Facing north on the bridge Banner for the bridge's namesake, Andy Warhol \"Knit the Bridge\" yarn bombing event on the bridge in August 2013 Historic plaque for Seventh Street Bridge.\nSee also[edit] List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Pennsylvania List of crossings of the Allegheny River.\nReferences[edit] ^ \"The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search\" .\n ^ The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search.\n^ Hamilton, Anita (August 13, 2013). \"Pittsburgh Bridge Gets a 'Yarn Bomb' Makeover\" .

His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best-known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell's Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962), the experimental films Empire (1964) and Chelsea Girls (1966), and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966–67). Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a commercial illustrator. After exhibiting his work in several galleries in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His New York studio, The Factory, became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons. He promoted a collection of personalities known as Warhol superstars, and is credited with inspiring the widely used expression \"15 minutes of fame\". In the late 1960s he managed and produced the experimental rock band The Velvet Underground and founded Interview magazine. He authored numerous books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism: The Warhol Sixties. He lived openly as a gay man before the gay liberation movement. In June 1968, he was almost killed by radical feminist Valerie Solanas,  who shot him inside his studio. After gallbladder surgery, Warhol died of cardiac arrhythmia in February 1987 at the age of 58 in New York. Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary films. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. A 2009 article in The Economist described Warhol as the \"bellwether of the art market\". Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is $105 million for a 1963 serigraph titled Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster). His works include some of the most expensive paintings ever sold.

{"id": 245, "data": "Skip to main content Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n Andy Warhol’s life may be better documented than that of any other artist in the history of the world. That is because, every few days or so, he would sweep all the stuff on his desk into a storage box, date it, label it “TC”—short for “time capsule”—and then store it, with all the preceding TCs, in a special place in his studio. As a result, we have his movie-ticket stubs, his newspaper clippings, his cowboy boots, his wigs, his collection of dental molds, his collection of pornography, the countless Polaroids he took of the people at the countless parties he went to—you name it. We have copies of bills he sent and also of bills he received from increasingly exasperated creditors, including one (“PAY UP YOU BLOWHARD”) from Giuseppe Rossi, the doctor who, in 1968, saved his life after a woman who felt she had been insufficiently featured in his movies came to his studio one day and shot him. In one box, I’ve heard, there is also a slice of cake, on a plate. It wasn’t just material objects he kept. When possible, he taped his phone conversations, and sometimes had an assistant type them up. He believed in the power of the banal. This faith was the wellspring of the Pop-art paintings—the Campbell’s soup cans, the Brillo cartons—that made him famous in the nineteen-sixties and changed America’s taste in art. After Warhol’s death, in 1987, a museum dedicated to his work was established in his home town, Pittsburgh. The time capsules—six hundred and ten of them—were shipped there and lined up on banks of metal shelving, ready for the person who would work their contents into a fittingly rich biography. Seven years ago, he arrived: Blake Gopnik, formerly the lead art critic of the Washington Post. (His brother, Adam, is a writer for this magazine.) Gopnik is fantastically thorough; the book is nine hundred pages long—not counting the seven thousand endnotes, available in the e-book edition or online. But you don’t lose heart, because Gopnik is a vivid chronicler. Here is a small clip from his description of the repair job Dr. Rossi did on Warhol’s innards after the 1968 shooting. The surgeon found two holes in the arc of the diaphragm muscle, pierced both right and left as the bullet crossed through Warhol’s body; an esophagus severed from the stomach, so that food and gastric acid were spilling out from below; a liver whose left lobe was mashed and bleeding and a spleen utterly destroyed and spilling more blood than any of the other organs. [The] bullet had also cut a ragged hole in Warhol’s intestines, releasing feces and upping the chances of fatal infection. Reading this, I felt as though I were having the operation myself. Warhol was born in Pittsburgh in 1928, the youngest of the three sons of Andrej and Julia Warhola, who had immigrated to the United States from a small village in what is now Slovakia. The townsfolk were Carpatho-Rusyns, a Slavic people, and the family was Byzantine Catholic. (Warhol, as an adult, sporadically went to Mass. “Church is a fun place to go,” he said.) Slavs were much in demand in Pittsburgh, with its steel mills, because they were reputedly willing to do any kind of work, at any wage. As a result, they were also the most looked-down-upon ethnic group in the city. Andrej was a manual laborer; Julia a domestic. When she didn’t have enough work, she went door to door, often with her sons in tow, selling decorative flowers made from cut-up peach cans. Andrej died in 1942. The two older boys quit school and took full-time jobs. Andy stayed in school. For most of his youth, he was cosseted by his family. When the Warhols acquired a new Baby Brownie Special camera ($1.25), he immediately laid hands on it, and never let it go. His brothers built him a darkroom in the basement. Also, he fell in love with the movies; he said that he wanted to make his living showing films. This was an unusual life plan for a boy of his background, but Julia saved nine dollars—nine days’ wages from her housecleaning—to buy him a projector. He showed Mickey Mouse cartoons on a wall in the apartment. Warhol liked to describe himself as self-educated, a widely accepted claim. In fact, he went to an excellent art college, the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where a number of his teachers recognized his gifts and kept the work that he turned in to them, a rare tribute. The minute he got out of school, in 1949, he packed his belongings in a paper bag and got on an overnight Greyhound bound for New York City. He was twenty. Warhol lived in a series of roach-ridden sublets, usually shares, while trying to break into commercial illustration. Once, when he was showing samples of his work to the editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar, an insect crawled out of his portfolio, to his mortification. The editor felt so sorry for him that she gave him an assignment. Warhol was not shy. In the Museum of Modern Art, he went up to a staffer and proposed that he design Christmas cards for the gift shop. (He got the job.) A friend remembered seeing him in a bookstore, flipping through the record bins to see which labels were doing the most interesting jackets. Then he went home and cold-called the art directors. “He was like a little Czech tank,” another friend said. Many people who met him in those years, and later, found him strange—a “weird little creep,” in the words of one. He was unabashedly homosexual, and in the early fifties that was weird enough. He liked to do drawings of nude boys, their nipples and crotches dotted with little hearts, like soft kisses. If he met a man who appealed to him, he might say that he liked to photograph penises, and would this man mind? “No, of course not,” one self-possessed British curator replied. “What are you going to use them for?” “Oh, I don’t know yet,” Warhol said. “I’m just taking the pictures.” The man unzipped. Three years after Warhol arrived in New York, his mother turned up on his doorstep. She explained to one of his friends, “I come here to take care of my Andy, and when he’s okay I go home.” She stayed for almost twenty years. The household had a large, smelly collection of Siamese cats. At one point, there were reportedly seventeen of them, mostly named Sam. (But Julia, pointing, could introduce them separately: “That’s the good Sam, that’s the bad Sam, that’s the dumb Sam . . .”) Between the cats and Julia’s late-life drinking problem, Warhol seems to have been hesitant to introduce her to his friends. On the other hand, one boyfriend said he thought Warhol was grateful for her presence, because it gave him an excuse not to have sex. He would explain to his guest that he didn’t want to make any bedroom noises as long as his mother was within earshot. Facebook Twitter Email Shopping.\nCartoon by Jack Ziegler.\nWarhol claimed that he was a virgin until he was twenty-five, and some people would say that that was no surprise. All his life, he was pained by his looks. He was cursed with terrible skin, not just acne but what seems to have been a disorder of pigment distribution, so that his complexion was lighter here, darker there. He also had a bulbous nose, or so he thought, and he got a nose job. By the time he was in his thirties, he had lost much of his hair. Thereafter, he glued a toupee to his scalp every morning. His most celebrated wig was a silver one, which he usually wore with a fringe of his brown hair peeping out at the neck. These difficulties boded ill for his sex life, and he was widely said to be lousy in bed. He thought sex was “messy and distasteful,” a friend reported. He’d do it with you once or twice, and that was it. Gopnik, as is his practice, also gives competing evidence: “Within a few years Warhol was having surgery for anal warts and a tear, and a decade later he was taking penicillin for a venereal disease.” Warhol’s friend and collaborator Taylor Mead said that Warhol “blows like crazy.” Warhol lied constantly, almost recreationally. He lied about his age even to his doctor. He told Who’s Who that he was born in Cleveland, to the “von Warhol” family. (He had traded in Warhola for Warhol soon after arriving in New York.) He adopted a gentle, whispery voice, into which he might then drop a little grenade. If someone asked how he was, he might say, “I’m okay,” and then, coming closer, he would add, “But I have diarrhea.” Some people thought he was stupid. Not those who knew him well. “Warhol only plays dumb,” a friend said. “He’s incredibly analytical, intellectual, and perceptive.” His commercial specialty was drawings for women’s-wear ads—above all, shoes. In 1955, the high-end women’s shoemaker I. Miller gave him a contract for a minimum of twelve thousand dollars’ worth of work per year, a lot of money at the time. He also did window dressing, notably for Bonwit Teller. But already he was looking beyond this: he wanted to be a gallery artist. Teachers and classmates from Carnegie Tech provided some connections, and Manhattan’s gay community supplied more. He also had a few special godfathers, attracted to him, it seems, by his charm (not everybody thought he was creepy) and by his drive. Perhaps his most important guide was Emile de Antonio, an artists’ agent, who introduced him all around; he knew John Cage, whom Warhol revered, and lots of collectors. (“I gave a little party for a terribly rich woman I knew,” de Antonio recalled, “and I served just marijuana and Dom Perignon, and Andy did a beautiful menu in French.”) Another useful person was Ivan Karp, the director of the Leo Castelli Gallery, Manhattan’s most prestigious art mart. Through Karp, Warhol eventually met Henry Geldzahler, a curatorial assistant at the Metropolitan Museum, whose job there was to find out who the hot new artists were and tell the curators. In the fifties, the United States already had a pocket of conceptual art, but the star painters were the Abstract Expressionists, above all Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, with their effortful drips and impastos. At the Ab Exes’ heels were the young Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, part conceptual, part painterly, and edging into “Pop,” a style that used imagery from mass culture—comic strips, movies, advertising—and adopted a light, playful tone, the very opposite of the Abstract Expressionists’ heavy lifting. Warhol, too, was interested in this popular matter and manner, and he was annoyed that other people were, as he saw it, stealing a march on him. According to a famous story, he was complaining about this to friends one night and asked if anyone could think of pop-culture images that no one else had used. A decorator named Muriel Latow said she had a suggestion, but she wanted fifty dollars, up front, before she would reveal it. The unembarrassable Warhol sat down and wrote a check. Then Latow said, “You’ve got to find something that’s recognizable to almost everybody . . . something like a can of Campbell’s Soup.” Gopnik calls this Warhol’s “eureka moment,” and it is typical of the book’s sophistication that the crucial, seedling idea of Warhol’s Pop art should be attributed, without apology, to someone other than Warhol. Often, artists who are praised for birthing a new trend are not the actual originators but the ones who made the trend appealing to a large public. Warhol had as much of the latter gift as of the former; Gopnik calls him “the Great Sponge.” In any case, the day after Latow shared with him her little brain bomb, Warhol (or his mother, in another version) went to the Finast supermarket across the street and came home with one can of every kind of Campbell’s soup on sale there. By the following year, 1962, he had produced “Campbell’s Soup Cans,” a montage of all thirty-two varieties. Today, this painting hangs in the Museum of Modern Art—“the ‘Nude Descending a Staircase’ of the Pop movement,” in the words of Henry Geldzahler. It is both a slap in the face and a great joy: so fresh, so brash, so red and white, so certain that it has covered every kind of soup in the world, from Pepper Pot to Scotch Broth. In rapid succession, the Campbell’s Soups were followed by Warhol’s other now famous Pop paintings: “Green Coca-Cola Bottles” (1962), “192 One Dollar Bills” (1962), “Brillo Soap Pads Box” (1964), the Marilyn Monroes and Elizabeth Taylors and Marlon Brandos and Elvises. For some, you can easily construct a background narrative. The “Marilyn Diptych,” comprising fifty silk screens of Monroe, fading from garish color to spectral black-and-white, was exhibited just after her death. But I see no story lurking behind the Liz Taylors or the Elvises or, for that matter, the panels of twenty-four Statues of Liberty (1962) or thirty Mona Lisas (1963). All of these ladies, not to speak of Elvis and Brando, were stars, and Warhol, from his childhood until the day he died, was enthralled by celebrity. He soon became a celebrity himself, if an unusual one. In his thirties, he was famous, in TV interviews, for putting two fingers over his lips and saying things like “er” or “um,” but not much more, as the cameras rolled. (You can see this on YouTube. It is discomforting to watch.) For live interviews, he would often bring along Gerard Malanga, who worked with him, and say, “Why don’t you ask my assistant Gerry Malanga some questions? He did a lot of my paintings.” There was some truth to this. Of the works listed above, all but the 1962 “Campbell’s Soup Cans” were silk screens, usually based on photographs that someone else had taken, and made with Malanga wielding the squeegee. From 1963 to 1972—the period during which he made most of his Pop art—Warhol produced no hand-drawn work. Running parallel to Warhol’s iconoclasm about authorship was a certain coolness toward his subjects. “For an artist with a lifelong reputation for sucking up to stars,” Gopnik writes, “Warhol also had a lifelong knack for making art that underlined their shortcomings and hollowness.” Probably the most important discussions of Warhol’s work are the books and essays that the philosopher Arthur Danto wrote on him from the mid-sixties onward. These are not exactly art criticism. Their scope is broader. Danto says that Warhol’s work, by disposing of modernism’s assertions that painting should be about the nature of painting, liberated it to go its own way, while the art critics stayed back in the schoolroom, arguing. Danto doesn’t say he loved Warhol’s work, but I think he did. I’m sorry that he liked the Brillo carton—it supplied the title of his book “Beyond the Brillo Box”—better than the Campbell’s soup cans, but he probably enjoyed the irony that the Brillo box Warhol immortalized was designed by an Abstract Expressionist painter, James Harvey, doing a money job on the side. The Ab Exes looked upon Warhol with hatred. At a party in the late sixties, a drunken de Kooning said to Warhol, “You’re a killer of art, you’re a killer of beauty, you’re even a killer of laughter.” Warhol didn’t kill laughter—he would have been less famous if he had done so—but his humor is muted, deadpan. In 1964, he produced a series of nine silk screens of Jacqueline Kennedy’s face, based on press photos: one that showed her in the famous pillbox hat, just before J.F.K. was shot; the second as Lyndon Johnson was being sworn in, on the airplane back to Washington; the third at Kennedy’s funeral. There was nothing overtly mocking about these works. But in 1964, when, in the public mind, Kennedy’s body was not yet cold, they raised a question: What was Warhol saying? Viewers might have asked the same of his earlier “Death and Disasters” series (1962-65), worked up from photographs of bloodied corpses hanging out of wrecked cars, mangled bodies of people who had jumped to their deaths, the electric chair in which Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, convicted of spying for the Soviet Union, were executed, and so on. Like the soup cans, the silk screens were often cheerfully multiplied and, like the Marilyns and the Liz Taylors, covered with washes of bright color: blue, red, violet, yellow. In the same year as the “Nine Jackies,” Warhol unveiled silk screens of his “Flowers,” big, blobby hibiscus blossoms against a grassy field. They looked like wallpaper or, as Gopnik suggests, Marimekko dress fabrics. In any case, they were something that, unlike a picture of an electric chair, you might be willing to hang over your living-room sofa. This was what they were apparently designed for, because Warhol (or Malanga) turned out more than four hundred and fifty of them, in different versions—different sizes, different colorways, to use Gopnik’s inspired word—and they sold like hotcakes. Warhol claimed to be proud of them. If I’m not mistaken, Gopnik doesn’t believe him. He quotes Warhol announcing, the following year, that he has retired as an artist. The “Flowers,” Gopnik writes, were “pretty much his last notable Pop paintings.” But, as the author does not flat-out say but repeatedly implies, they were also pretty much Warhol’s last notable paintings, period. “I hate paintings,” he told a reporter in 1966, adding, “That’s why I started making movies.” He had made his first film in 1963. Titled “Sleep,” it was five and a half hours long, and all it showed was his boyfriend, John Giorno, sleeping. The next year, he followed this up with “Empire,” eight hours, overnight, of the Empire State Building, shot from a window in the nearby Time-Life Building. Thereafter, until the mid-seventies, he made scores of movies, some of them pure and severe, like “Sleep” and “Empire,” and others, such as “The Chelsea Girls” and “Lonesome Cowboys,” shambling and funny and dirty, with drag queens sitting around licking bananas or people having dilatory conversations about sex, or having sex. But the movies were not just movies. They were the motion-picture wing of what was by now a whole “scene.” In 1964, Warhol moved his professional headquarters into a vast space he came to call the Factory—it had housed a hat factory before he moved in—on East Forty-seventh Street, just west of the United Nations. The place was filthy, but Warhol’s friend Billy Name (né Billy Linich, but Linich was a name, right? So why not just go by Name?) moved in with a pack of fellow speed freaks and transformed the space with tinfoil and spray paint, so that in the end every surface was silver. Just as Warhol’s movies were not merely movies, the Factory was not merely a place where things were made. It was also a showcase for a certain group of people who clustered around Warhol. Billy Name was one; Gerard Malanga another. Also important was Ondine (Robert Olivo), wild and vicious. Best known to outsiders was Edie Sedgwick, a sweet-faced and rather hapless rich girl who, in black tights and expensive sweaters, often went along on Warhol’s outings, as his “date,” and paid the tab. These and a few others were Warhol’s superstars, as he called them. In 1966, he also became the manager of a proto-punk rock band, the Velvet Underground, hatchery of Lou Reed, John Cale, and others, all pretty much unknown at that point. One of its members described a typical show: “Some sailors or something were in the audience of five, and we played something and they said, ‘You play that again and we’ll fuck the shit out of you.’ So we played it again.” “Our aim was to upset people,” one of the band’s founders said, “make them vomit.” Warhol knew little about music, and he and the Velvets broke up in less than a year. (“Always leave them wanting less,” Warhol said.) But for a while Warhol’s film showings and performances—notably, “The Exploding Plastic Inevitable” and “★★★★”—were multimedia events, featuring the superstars bopping around in a desultory fashion to the Velvets’ discordant strains while two or more films were projected side by side or, indeed, in superimposition.\n It hardly needs to be said that drugs were involved here, and this fact, augmented with reminiscences of Warhol’s associates, has contributed to a portrait of him as a sort of Mephistopheles, luring his young friends to their ruin. A key story is that of Freddy Herko, part of the West Village postmodern-dance scene in the sixties. One day, a while after he had stopped hanging around the Factory, Herko took a bubble bath, and some LSD, at a friend’s apartment, danced naked for a while, and then, to the strains of Mozart’s “Coronation Mass,” threw himself out a window. When informed of Herko’s death, Warhol commented that he was sorry not to have been there to film the fall. This story won him an enduring reputation, with those so minded, as an emotionless person, a sort of freak—an image reinforced by his paintings of soup cans and electric chairs. Cold heart, cold art. Gopnik doesn’t say whether or not he believes the report, but he concludes that, if it is true, it says as much about Warhol’s desire to shock as about his supposed lack of feeling. He also points out that Warhol used the joke more than once. When his relationship with Edie Sedgwick was coming to an end—she ran off with Bob Dylan—he said to a friend, “When do you think Edie will commit suicide? I hope she lets us know, so we can film it.” If this was nasty, it was also clear-eyed: six years later, Sedgwick died of a barbiturate overdose. Warhol also applied the joke to himself, saying that he always regretted that no one had been there, in 1968, to film him being gunned down. On June 3, 1968, Valerie Solanas emerged from the elevator at the Factory. She was a local eccentric, the founder and sole member of a feminist organization she called SCUM, the Society for Cutting Up Men. She was also, apparently, suffering from an acute mental disorder. She had previously drifted into Warhol’s studio a few times and he had put her in a sexploitation film, “I, a Man,” in 1967. She felt he should have used her more, and this was the reason for her visit. Entering the studio, she fired several times at Warhol and also put a bullet in a friend of his who was visiting. Then she turned around and stepped back into the elevator. A few hours later, in Times Square, she told a bewildered cop, “The police are looking for me. I am a flower child. He had too much control over my life.” (She got three years. “You get more for stealing a car,” Lou Reed said.) Meanwhile, an ambulance had taken Warhol to Columbus Hospital, where he was laid out on a table for Dr. Rossi’s ministrations. His mother, summoned by one of his associates, stood in the lobby, praying for her “good, religious boy.” The doctors had her sedated and taken home. After the surgery, Warhol stayed in the hospital for two months, eating candy, talking on the phone, and trying to manage the studio from afar. Gopnik describes the assault by Solanas as the dividing line between Warhol’s “before” and his “after.” He slowly got rid of his disreputable entourage, or they, feeling less valued, left him. He acquired fancier friends, like Lee Radziwill and Mick Jagger. He bought an estate in Montauk, and a chocolate-brown Rolls to go with it. In 1969, he founded Interview, a publication that was advertised as being devoted to movies (the original title was inter/VIEW: A Monthly Film Journal) but soon became a magazine about celebrities. Apparently, he did not often work on it—one of the early editors said he never read it until the printer delivered it—but it helped to snag clients for another department of his activities, the manufacture of silk-screen portraits of friends, patrons, and assorted big names: Dennis Hopper, Dominique de Menil, Gianni Versace, the Shah of Iran, Chris Evert, Dolly Parton, Imelda Marcos. Seeing Warhol’s brush with death as a watershed has obvious narrative appeal, but, on the evidence of Gopnik’s chronicle, the “after” had been coming for a while. Like most of Warhol’s Pop paintings, the great majority of his films were made in less than five years. Then, it seems, he got bored. He fielded a few works in the I-dare-you-to-say-this-isn’t-art manner of his hero and friend Marcel Duchamp, who, by exhibiting a signed urinal, in 1917, more or less invented conceptual art. In 1972, at Finch College, in New York, Warhol did his “vacuum-cleaner piece,” which involved his vacuuming a patch of carpet in the college’s art gallery, signing the dust bag, propping it on a pedestal, and going home. But, as Gopnik points out, “Where Duchamp’s urinal had involved a transformation of the banal into art, if only by the artist’s say-so, Warhol’s update involved jettisoning transformation altogether so that banality itself, left to do its banal thing, could count as high art.” “Let me just check my e-mail, my texts, my missed calls, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, my credit score, my horoscope, the results of this latest personality test, the S. & P., the Dow, the news, this article about cute dogs, and the weather, and then we can go.” Facebook Twitter Email Shopping.\nCartoon by Amy Kurzweil.\nSome years before, Warhol had placed an ad in the Village Voice: “I’ll endorse with my name any of the following; clothing AC-DC, cigarettes small, tapes, sound equipment, ROCK N’ ROLL RECORDS, anything, film, and film equipment, Food, Helium, Whips, MONEY!! love and kisses Andy Warhol, EL 5-9941.” This comically blatant announcement—the phone number was Warhol’s real office number—can’t seriously have been intended to bring in cash. Rather, it proclaimed that, henceforward, “selling out” would be, for Warhol, an aesthetic move. But gradually the sellout pose stuck. When, two years later, Warhol told a reporter that his artistic medium was “business,” he meant it. In Gopnik’s words, this declaration “launched a new approach to his life and his art that would mold both for the following two decades, and then shape his reputation for all the years afterward.” Reverting to his I. Miller days, he began designing ads: a sundae for Schrafft’s, a limited-edition bottle for Absolut vodka, and the like. He also had an idea for a chain of Andy-Mat diners. “They’re for people who eat alone,” he explained. “You sit at a little table, order up any sort of frozen food you want, and watch TV at the same time. Everyone has his own TV set.” Warhol’s new enterprises didn’t take up much of his time. Gopnik says that the artist gave maybe two days each to the later silk-screen portraits—and that it showed. “Ever more vacant,” Gopnik calls these paintings. Unsurprisingly, Warhol’s star fell. By the time, in the early eighties, that he began doing collaborative paintings with Jean-Michel Basquiat—Gopnik guesses that the young prodigy reminded the older man of his earlier self—the association was enough to damage Basquiat’s reputation. A critic for the Times wrote that their work together looked “like one of Warhol’s manipulations, which increasingly seem based on the Mencken theory about nobody going broke underestimating the public’s intelligence. Basquiat, meanwhile, comes across as the all too willing accessory.” Basquiat soon distanced himself, which hurt Warhol. Gopnik feels, too, that Warhol was not as indifferent to artistic quality as he made himself out to be. Soon after the Centre Pompidou, in Paris, opened, Warhol spent a day looking at its modern-art masterworks and wrote in his diary, “I wanted to just rush home and paint and stop doing society portraits.” Still, many rich people were happy to have him do portraits of them. This third arm of his empire fell into a neat synergy with the others—the fancy Montauk house, the celebrity magazine—and made him a lot of money. He enjoyed spending it. He liked to buy loose diamonds and walk around jiggling them in his pocket. In his later years, he went antique shopping most mornings and eventually bought around a million dollars’ worth of heirloom furniture. He had no space for most of it in his living quarters and therefore had to stash it in empty rooms upstairs. Warhol once tried to give an old friend one of his Marilyn Monroe silk screens, and the man, who disliked Pop, said, “Just tell me in your heart of hearts that you know it isn’t art.” Warhol, imperturbable, answered, “Wrap it up in brown paper, put it in the back of a closet—one day it will be worth a million dollars.” He was right, Gopnik says, but off by two orders of magnitude: in 2008, a Warhol silk screen sold for a hundred million dollars. There was no huger reputation than Warhol’s in the art of the sixties, and in late-twentieth-century art there was no more important decade than the sixties. Much of the art that has followed, in the United States, is unthinkable without him, without his joining of high culture and low, without his love of sizzle and flash, without his combination of tenderness and sarcasm, without the use of photography and silk-screening and advertising. If any artist of the past half century deserves a biography as detailed as this one, then, it is Warhol. Still, the long tail end of Warhol’s career forces Gopnik into some tight corners as a critic. He acknowledges that, even by the end of the sixties, Warhol was treading water as an artist. I believe that’s true, and that Gopnik thinks so, too. Yet elsewhere, and often, he tries to defend Warhol against the charge of having made inferior work in the seventies and eighties. Most frustrating are the instances when he excuses mediocre paintings by saying that mediocrity was what Warhol was going for, and that we should congratulate him for having achieved his goal. At times, the defenses reminded me of the philosopher Karl Popper’s famous objection to Freudian analysis, on the ground that it was “unfalsifiable.” (If you said that you’d never wanted to have sex with your mother, this was instantly interpretable, via the theory of repression, as an admission that you wanted to have sex with your mother. If, on the other hand, you said that you wanted to have sex with your mother, voilà: you wanted to have sex with your mother.) Gopnik writes that, in the sixties and seventies, “ ‘Andy Warhol’ may have promoted some banal popular culture. Andy Warhol, the brilliant artist inside those quotes, could be counted on to turn it into art.” Really? How can you tell the difference between the two? “Anything bad is right,” Warhol declared, and Gopnik calls this “as close as he ever came to a guiding aesthetic principle.” But is it a good principle—not just for Warhol, but for us? Better, surely, just to acknowledge that the bad stuff was bad than to try to turn its badness into a postmodern triumph. If special pleading for the late period is the book’s one real weakness, its great strength is its tone. In his time, Warhol was very controversial. Some people thought he was a genius; others, that he should be arrested. Gopnik, though he does believe that his subject is a genius, treats him fairly, calmly, and fondly. If Warhol tells a good joke, Gopnik relays it. In the hospital, soon after he was shot, Warhol said to a friend, “You know, we gotta get some bigger things to hide behind.” When the artist stuffs a photograph of Brando down the front of his pants, we hear about it. As for Warhol’s love life, Gopnik manages to convince us, without sentimentality, that, however many cute guys Warhol went through, he always just wanted to fall in love with somebody and settle down. He did fall in love, often—usually with someone who loved him less—but it never worked out for long. The last boyfriend, Jon Gould, a young vice-president at Paramount, declined to sleep in Warhol’s room with him, saying that the artist’s dachshunds farted on him in bed. Gould died of AIDS within a few years. Then, there is Warhol’s mother, with whom he lived for most of his life. By the time he was courting Jon Gould, Julia, now in her late seventies, was downstairs, going bats, hiding food in secret places around the house. In 1971, she moved back to Pittsburgh, living first with one of Warhol’s brothers and then in a nursing home. A cousin repeatedly wrote to Warhol, telling him that Julia survived only in the hope that Andy would visit her before she died. He didn’t visit, nor, eventually, did he attend her funeral, though he paid for it. One day soon afterward, a reporter asked him what was on his mind. He answered, “I think about my bird that died. If it went to bird heaven. But I really can’t think about that. It just took a walk.” Fifteen years after his mother died, Warhol, fifty-eight, followed her. It’s a wonder that he lasted that long. All his later life, he suffered from an infected gallbladder. He wore a girdle—there’s a collection of them, dyed in pretty colors, in the time capsules—just to keep his guts in. He was in constant pain. Finally, one day in February of 1987, he checked himself into New York Hospital. When the surgeons pulled out his gallbladder, they found it falling apart with gangrene. He died the next morning. ♦.\nJoan Acocella has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1995.

Andy Warhol 1928, Pittsburgh, US — 1987, New York, US.\nShare Andy Warhol was born Andrew Warhola in Pittsburgh on August 6, 1928. He received a BFA from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh in 1949. That same year he moved to New York, where he soon became successful as a commercial artist and illustrator. During the 1950s Warhol’s drawings were published in Glamour and other magazines and displayed in department stores. He became known for his illustrations of I. Miller shoes. In 1952 the Hugo Gallery in New York presented a show of Warhol’s illustrations for Truman Capote’s writings. He traveled in Europe and Asia in 1956. In the early 1960s Warhol began to paint comic-strip characters and images derived from advertisements; this work was characterized by the repetition of banal subjects such as Coca-Cola bottles and soup cans. He also painted celebrities at this time. Warhol’s new paintings were exhibited for the first time in 1962, initially at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, and then in a solo exhibition at the Stable Gallery in New York. In 1962 he began to employ primarily a silkscreen process in place of hand painting. Working with assistants, he produced series of works depicting “death and disaster,” flowers, and cows, as well as portraits. He also made three-dimensional facsimiles of Brillo boxes and cartons of other well-known household products. Starting in the mid-1960s, at the Factory, his New York studio, Warhol concentrated on making films often featuring lengthy depictions of everyday activities, as in Sleep and Eat (both 1963). In the early 1970s he began to paint again, returning to gestural brushwork and producing monumental portraits of Mao Tse-tung, commissioned portraits, and the Hammer and Sickle series. He also became interested in writing: his autobiography, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again), was published in 1975, and the Factory published Interview magazine. A major retrospective of Warhol’s work organized by the Pasadena Art Museum in Pasadena, California, in 1970 traveled in the United States and abroad. Warhol died on February 22, 1987, in New York.\n Andy Warhol Flowers 1964 On view.\nWe use cookies to deliver our online services and to provide more personalized services to you.

All rights reserved DACS, 2021 The Gallerie dell’Accademia di Venezia is delighted to announce that Anish Kapoor will be the first British artist to be honoured with a major exhibition at the museum. The exhibition, postponed from 2021 because of the pandemic, will be presented during the Venice International Art Biennale in 2022, opening on 20 April and running until 9 October 2022.  The curator is art historian Taco Dibbits, General Director of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The exhibition will be a comprehensive retrospective presenting key moments in Kapoor’s career and exploring the development of his unique visual language. For the first time, ground-breaking new works, created using carbon nanotechnology, will be shown. These new works further develop the language of Kapoor’s seminal sculptures, which explore the condition of what he has termed the ‘non-object’ - works that investigate the liminal space occupied by an object, between physical presence and immateriality, something that is present but absent, empty yet full.

All rights reserved DACS, 2021 The project is part of the Accademia’s long-term programming focused on contemporary art. This reflects the history of the museum, which is also an academy for the training of contemporary artists. It rises to the challenge to open up new opportunities for a dialogue between past and present. Giulio Manieri Elia, the Accademia’s Director, says: “With the retrospective dedicated to Maestro Anish Kapoor, following the major exhibitions dedicated to Philip Guston in 2017 and Georg Baselitz in 2019, the Gallerie dell'Accademia again opens its doors to contemporary art. In the past, a \"pittore pittore\", what you might call a painters’ painter, has always been chosen, in the light of their affinity with the museum's collection. Our choice of sculptor might seem a surprise, but Kapoor, because of his original and deep research into colour, light, perspective and space, grows from the roots of venetian Renaissance painting, investigating its essence and interacting intimately on an ideal - we could even say conceptual - level with Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto”. Kapoor’s works set up a dynamic dialogue with the Medieval and Renaissance art in the collection.  Kapoor’s use of the skin of an object as veil between the inner and outer world echoes the motif of the fold in Renaissance art, where it serves as a boundary between body, skin and being, between the corporeal and the sacred. Such investigations of the embodied subject lead to the modernity of Malevich, Newman and Rothko. Kapoor continues this investigation with sensual and intriguing sculptures that question the status of both matter and being.

All rights reserved DACS, 2021 Taco Dibbits said: “All artists, however cutting-edge and contemporary, are in debate with those who have gone before. The Gallerie dell’Accademia is the perfect site for a modern master to explore in contemporary form the themes that have always engaged sculptors and painters. Kapoor’s latest works, using the most advanced nanotechnology, promise to be a revelation.” Anish Kapoor said: “The light and space of Venice, and the glories of the Accademia’s collection, have long been an inspiration to me. I have come to love this city and its painters, sculptors and architects, and I feel honoured to be invited to engage in a visual dialogue with them. I hope I will be able to add something to the vocabulary of colour and form that has been Venice’s gift to the world.” Void Pavilion V, 2018\nWood, concrete and pigment\n6x6x12m\nPhotograph by Nobutada Omote \n©Anish Kapoor.

The exhibition at Fondazione Prada —curated by the artist himself—  features works such as My Body Your Body (1993), Cloud (1995) and Turning the World Upside Down (1995), whose distinguishing characteristics are the use of three-dimensional forms (made of wood, fiberglass, stainless steel, sandstone…) containing an inner space coated inside with the colors of darkness: blue and black powdered pigment.

{"id": 272, "data": "Venice Biennale 2022 preview.\nAnish Kapoor will bring the ‘world’s blackest black’ to Venice's Accademia The first British artist is finally exhibiting his sculptures using the controversial Vantablack. Lee Cheshire 11 April 2022 Share Kapoor’s Void Pavilion V (2018), made with Vantablack. He gained exclusive rights to use the pigment in works of art Photo: Nobutada Omote; © Anish Kapoor They have been years in the making and sparked an art world spat. But we will at last see the sculptures Anish Kapoor has made using the “world’s blackest black” in this expansive two-venue retrospective. It’s not surprising that Kapoor was attracted to the wonder material Vantablack, which was created by UK-based company Surrey NanoSystems. In work going back to the 1990s, Kapoor has experimented with the possibilities of deep, pure colour, from void-like black holes in the floor to walk-in cocoons of rich red. The properties of Vantablack—a coating that uses a forest of tiny carbon tubes to absorb nearly all the light shining on it, thus making it hard to discern shape—are tailor-made for Kapoor’s interests. The problems came when Kapoor gained exclusive rights to use the coating in works of art. Other artists have decried this monopoly—most notably Stuart Semple, who hit back with a range of paints including the “pinkest pink” that are available to buy by anyone who affirms they are not Anish Kapoor. (Kapoor managed to acquire a pot nonetheless and posted a picture of his pink-painted middle finger on Instagram.) Kapoor is the first British artist to be given an exhibition in the Accademia, Venice’s venerable gallery of Old Master paintings. The show will also take place in Palazzo Manfrin close to Venice’s train station, in the Cannaregio district on the other side of the city. The Anish Kapoor Foundation began converting the dilapidated 18th-century mansion last year, and it will eventually become the foundation’s headquarters, with an exhibition venue, artist studio and a repository for some of his most important works. The location is fitting—the palazzo was once a popular picture gallery visited by Lord Bryon and Édouard Manet. Many of its paintings are now in the collection of the Accademia. Dialogue with the past Alongside Kapoor’s black works, the exhibition will reflect key moments in the artist’s career, as well as recent paintings and sculptures. It is curated by the director of the Rijksmuseum, Taco Dibbits, who curated an exhibition of Kapoor’s work alongside Rembrandt’s at the Amsterdam museum in 2015. Dibbits says: “All artists, however cutting edge and contemporary, are in debate with those who have gone before. The Gallerie dell’Accademia is the perfect site for a modern master to explore the themes that have always engaged sculptors and painters. Kapoor’s latest works, using the most advanced nanotechnology, promise to be a revelation.” • Anish Kapoor, Gallerie dell'Accademia and Palazzo Manfrin, 20 April-9 October.\nVenice Biennale 2022 Anish Kapoor Exhibitions.\nShare \n", "label": [[0, 15, "EVENT"], [16, 20, "DATE"], [30, 42, "ARTIST"], [86, 92, "GPE"], [216, 229, "DATE"], [236, 242, "ARTIST"], [245, 260, "WORK_OF_ART"], [262, 266, "DATE"], [360, 374, "ARTIST"], [378, 390, "ARTIST"], [496, 508, "ARTIST"], [621, 627, "ARTIST"], [698, 700, "GPE"], [761, 766, "DATE"], [768, 774, "ARTIST"], [1091, 1097, "ARTIST"], [1134, 1140, "ARTIST"], [1255, 1268, "ARTIST"], [1396, 1408, "ARTIST"], [1411, 1417, "ARTIST"], [1525, 1531, "ARTIST"], [1593, 1602, "MUSEUM"], [1604, 1610, "GPE"], [1689, 1704, "GALLERY"], [1714, 1720, "GPE"], [1800, 1823, "GALLERY"], [1857, 1869, "DATE"], [2212, 2221, "MUSEUM"], [2256, 2262, "ARTIST"], [2423, 2434, "MUSEUM"], [2436, 2448, "CURATOR"], [2479, 2485, "ARTIST"], [2522, 2538, "MUSEUM"], [2542, 2546, "DATE"], [2548, 2555, "CURATOR"], [2666, 2689, "MUSEUM"], [2895, 2907, "ARTIST"], [2909, 2932, "MUSEUM"], [2937, 2952, "GALLERY"], [2954, 2972, "DATE"], [2974, 2989, "EVENT"], [2990, 2994, "DATE"], [2995, 3007, "ARTIST"]]}
