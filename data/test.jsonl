The title is referencing the crucial role of Rebellion in the artistic process, and how it’s so important for an artist to reject or ignore tradition to create something new. Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery There’s a lot of irony in this because Ghenie is creating abstract, figurative versions of famous artists’ work throughout art history such as Turner, Monet, and Van Gogh. However, he’s paying tribute to the fact that these artists were in fact rebels of their time. And he strives to do the same in his work. Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery “As disruptors of academic painting, these artists affirmed the materiality of oil paints with their loose brushstrokes, while amplifying painting’s optical qualities, namely its immersive luminosity and chromatic richness” (source) Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery “When I look at the Impressionists, I have the strange feeling that I am looking at something very schizophrenic. Behind those harmless colorful landscapes there is an incredible, destructive force—camouflaged. It is an act of hooliganism.” - Adrian Ghenie (source) Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery To push the boundaries by inserting small modern details like a baseball hat or sneakers in the same way. Ghenie is trying to convey a feeling rather than tell an obvious story. Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery “The word hooliganism suggests something loud, exterior, aggressive and in your face. But in art it shows itself in the most discrete ways. Caravaggio’s pilgrims with dirty feet, for example. He was the first to paint the actual dirt on their feet. Such a small detail but it had such power, that it could defy the church. Or when he chose a prostitute drowned in the Tiber as his model for the dead Virgin Mary. Or Cézanne’s bathers, for example—they are a mockery of the Greco-Roman and Prussian canons, but this is a mockery that made Picasso possible. Turner! Oh my God! To paint a train… when everybody was obsessed with the greatness of nature and the heroism of the past” - Adrian Ghenie (source) Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery I think that’s what I like most about abstract expressionism. It’s not as on-the-nose but still gives the viewer enough to emotionally attach to. Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery “Adrian is an extremely talented painter and manages to engender the feeling of something rather than explicitly outlining exactly what it is. He’s adept at drawing from the past—be it key figures or events from history—but while doing this he simultaneously catapults his work and his canvases into the future by inventing something entirely new. It is never formulaic and always evolving.” - Curator Jane Neal (source) Adrian Ghenie at Pace Gallery Walkthrough of the Exhibit To see a walkthrough of the exhibit, skip ahead to 3:31 in the video below.

{"id": 25, "data": "Skip to content  Artist: Adrian Ghenie Venue: Tim Van Laere Gallery, Antwerp, Belgium Date: October 15 – November 28, 2020 Photography: all images copyright and courtesy of the artist and Tim Van Laere Gallery, Antwerp Tim Van Laere Gallery presents the fifth solo exhibition of Adrian Ghenie, featuring nine new paintings and three new charcoal drawings. Adrian Ghenie was born in 1977 in the Romanian city of Baia Mare. He graduated from the Art and Design University of Cluj-Napoca and now lives and works in both Berlin and Cluj. In 2015 he was selected to represent Romania at the 56th Venice Biennale. His work is in important public collections worldwide, including: The Hermitage, St Petersburg; Museum of Contemporary Art (M HKA), Antwerp; S.M.A.K., Ghent; Tate Modern, London; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Metropolitan Museum, New York; The Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Long Museum, Shanghai; SFMOMA, San Francisco; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Adrian Ghenie’s work is characterized by a remarkable wealth of pictorial fragments with a flowing and hallucinatory spatial arrangement that results in a collage-like gathering of distinct pictorial motifs, a hedonistic sensuality and an innovative, radical and eclectic interpretation of the most diverse subjects. Ghenie’s extensive knowledge of our history in all its various facets reveals itself in the different motifs: ranging from obscure historical stories via mystical narratives about profane figures to the mythologizing of his own figure. For example, his work Medusa, 2020 combines aspects from the history of Nazi Germany with Greek mythology, while the artist interweaves his own figure with an art-historical reference in Self-Portrait with Picassoesque Background, 2020 and reinterprets the work of Henri Rousseau in Untitled (After Henri Rousseau), 2020. By exploring different historical and artistic narratives and at the same time undermining them in his work, Ghenie brings feelings of vulnerability, frustration or longing to the fore and challenges our collective memory to reflect also on the human aspect behind these stories. Adrian Ghenie combines different aspects of historical painting techniques. For instance, he demonstrates an expert mastery of baroque chiaroscuro, but also of the expressive use of paint that is a feature of abstract expressionism. He combines these technical skills with a profound interest in the activation of symbolic meanings behind specific images. A conceptual component that was important for the Dada movement as well as for the Flemish primitives and Flemish baroque masters. Ghenie’s interest in Flemish art history has left several traces in his work, which contains various references to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Jan Van Eyck, Peter Paul Rubens, Paul De Vos and Frans Snyders. He has also drawn inspiration from the hunting scenes of Flemish baroque painters for Park Scene, 2020 and The Hunter 3, 2020. Ghenie has a profound affinity with Antwerp, which he calls ‘the battleground of painting’.

{"id": 36, "data": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Ai Weiwei, photographed on 2 February in his Berlin studio. Photograph: Steffen Roth/The Observer The Chinese artist answers questions from Observer readers and art world luminaries on creativity and protest, Chinese politics – and why he never cooks the same dish twice by Tim Lewis.\nSun 22 Mar 2020 10.00 GMT Last modified on Tue 13 Apr 2021 15.48 BST.\nAi Weiwei’s studio can be found behind unmarked, black metal doors in a grand square in the old east Berlin. You immediately descend two flights of very steep stone stairs before emerging, blinking for light, into a vast, brick-lined cavern that has the proportions of a church. The temperature drops a few degrees. The space was originally, back in the mid-19th century, the cooling warehouses for the Bavarian brewer Joseph Pfeffer. But, since Ai fled China five years ago, this has been his main place of work – and, given that the 62-year-old artist and activist is almost always working, more besides. “When I’m here, it’s like my home,” says Ai, who wears a blue hoodie and comfortable shoes, his beard less unruly than it appears in photographs. “Like my home,” he clarifies. “I’ve never had a home. In China, my studio was often destroyed. So for me, it’s a shelter – a shelter not so different from refugees in the camps that gradually build up. I can leave, of course, but since 2015, I have stayed here, never had a holiday or weekends. I’m working all the time.” His face crinkles into a smile: “I love work.” Ai’s output is prolific and diverse. In 2008, he was the artistic consultant for the Olympic Stadium in Beijing, the Bird’s Nest. Two years later, he filled the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern with 100m handmade and painted porcelain sunflower seeds. Early in his career, he made a photo series of himself dropping a splendid, 2,000-year-old Han dynasty urn. Recently, he has created several powerful works – installations, video and a documentary – on the refugee crisis. War and its fallout is also the subject of his latest work, History of Bombs. In China they say, you’re born as a nude person, you die as a nude person. You should understand both ends Until the coronavirus outbreak, Ai’s design – a grid of 50 explosive devices from a 1911 grenade to a 2019 guided nuclear missile – was due to cover the floor of the Imperial War Museum London’s vast atrium, underneath the suspended Spitfire and Harrier jet, leading visitors to the spring exhibition, Refugees: Forced to Flee. Now the exhibition is postponed and Ai says when contacted last week: “Cultural institutions are probably the last to be damaged, but the first to show how severely this can affect our understanding about art and culture, which reflect tragic human moments like this. It is very hard to predict the future, but it seems like the situation is not going to be easily resolved and will have a strong impact. All the factors that allowed for this incident still remain the same – this could happen again – and a more thoughtful response in terms of social structure and the philosophical understanding of this situation is required.” Ai’s notoriety now of course reaches far beyond the art world. He took the 99-year lease on his Berlin studio in 2010 when he was starting to worry about his safety – his freedom – in China. He was right to be concerned: in April 2011, he was arrested and jailed for 81 days on insubstantial charges. His passport was confiscated and only returned to him in 2015, at which point he came to Germany. Ai Weiwei in his Berlin studio. Photograph: Steffen Roth/The Observer.\n“When a friend showed me the space, it was in a very bad condition,” Ai recalls. “That’s why nobody wanted it: it’s dark, it’s wet, it’s cold. There’s no light down here. So I said: ‘I want it.’ He was surprised and said: ‘Why do you want it?’ And I said: ‘Because there are so many problems, and I like to solve problems!’” Before Ai was an artist, he was an architect, and it shows. The studio now has natural light from goodness knows where, and is clinically clean and dry. For the most part, anyway. A while back, he discovered water dripping from the ceiling, so he went to see his upstairs neighbour, the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, about it. “Olafur is my dear friend, but we don’t see each other very often, maybe once every three months,” says Ai. “So I said: ‘Olafur, it’s leaking!’ And he said: ‘Oh, I’m sorry.’ And I said: ‘No, don’t worry, I’ll call it a waterfall and when you have the chance, come down to sign it!’” Those who follow Ai’s work and pronouncements might be surprised to learn that he still has a base in Berlin. At the end of last year, he moved with his partner and 10-year-old son to Cambridge. In January, he gave an interview to the Guardian in which he was so excoriating about life in Germany that you might imagine that he would never set foot in the country again. Germans, he said, “deeply don’t like foreigners”. He went even further: nazism – by his definition, as an ideology that dismisses alternative viewpoints – “perfectly exists in German daily life today”. One of six containers that comprise Ai Weiwei’s work S.A.C.R.E.D, 2015. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images.\nWhat has been the reaction to these comments in Germany? “When I chat like this, it is only because journalists ask me and I have to answer,” says Ai. “The German response was very heavy, very dark – a form of ‘love it or leave it’, or ‘go back to China’ . Or the more intellectual was: ‘Oh, it’s only a few taxi drivers.’ And I said, ‘Yes, but that is a long ride.’” Ai guffaws, but he’s totally serious. He has to keep his studio in Berlin for now, but would like to relocate. “I know I would never get a place like this, but so what?” he says. “Many people have to leave their nation barehanded, and maybe before they used to have a palace. In China they say, you’re born as a nude person, you die as a nude person. You should understand both ends.” One of the differences Ai sees between the UK and Germany is the engagement with his work and his opinions. He says that he has done more interviews in one week with the British media than in five years with German outlets. “The Hong Kong riots, the corona situation – I thought the German press would ask what we think about it, right?” he says. “I’m not blaming them or asking for this, but it makes me feel kind of like I’m in China, because my name cannot be written.” On the evidence of this feature, a You Ask the Questions special, there is certainly an intense fascination with Ai in Britain (there are also at least a couple of questions from Germany, and submissions from all over the world). The many hundreds of inquiries ranged from his early life (Ai’s father Ai Qing was a notable poet who was ostracised for criticising the Maoist regime; the family lived in a cave for five years and his father was made to clean the village toilet) to his opinions on music and food (he’s obsessed with one, not the other). At one point Ai stops me mid-sentence and marvels: “You have important questions from a lot of powerful people! Amazing!” Subject to any further disruption due to coronavirus, IWM plans to open History of Bombs this summer at IWM London as part of IWM’s Refugees season. Questions from cultural figures Maria Balshaw\nDirector of the Tate galleries You have moved to the UK just as we leave the European Union. What does the idea of the nation state mean to you?\nIf you take a historical view, our map is always changing. It continues to evolve. That might be a king’s decision or the people’s decision in a democracy. I don’t think Brexit is a problem. I’ve asked many people and Britain is Britain. It has problems, but it’s still there and this doesn’t add more problems. So it’s a time for people to rethink what Britain is and how to survive. Julian Schnabel\nArtist and film-maker What is the most satisfying thing to you about being an artist?\nTo not even think that I am an artist has been very satisfying for my work. Wolfgang Tillmans\nArtist In free societies, people often have the romantic feeling that better art is produced in circumstances of hardship. What would you say to that?\nThis is a tricky question. I would say that many bad artworks have come from circumstances of hardship. But hardship can also be defined as a long period of mental and intellectual struggle. Marcel Duchamp’s work, The Large Glass [also known as The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even] looks very casual. Duchamp had the lightest attitude towards art but his mindset was formed over a long time, taking in poetry, French literature, the attitudes of that generation, Dadaism and surrealism. The Large Glass speaks of all of that. Jude Kelly\nTheatre director If artists aren’t active in the political space, do you think that they are essentially supporting the status quo?\nAn artist must also be an activist – aesthetically, morally, or philosophically. That doesn’t mean they have to demonstrate in street protests, but rather deal with these issues through a so-called artistic language. Without that kind of consciousness – to be blind to human struggle – one cannot even be called an artist. Hans Ulrich Obrist\nArtistic director, Serpentine Galleries What is your unrealised project?\nThat will be death. In my life I have gone through pretty much every single trauma: communism, postmodernism, post-capitalism and globalisation, but the only project I think everyone realises is death. I know nothing about death. I haven’t met anybody who has come back to tell me their experience. So I’m waiting for the moment and it will come sooner or later. I’m happy with the work I’ve done, even though I have done so little. Often in life you don’t get the chance to do what you want. For me, that period lasted almost 45 years: I either didn’t know what I wanted to do or I knew what I wanted but I didn’t get the chance to do it. But since 2005, when I touched a computer for the first time and started to learn how to type, I began working on the internet and have been reborn. So in the past 15 years, I basically did everything and I’m pretty satisfied. If I have to die now, I have no regrets. Tim Marlow\nDirector of the Design Museum Given you’ve designed buildings as well as installed art in a whole variety of different spaces, what can artists and architects learn from each other?\nThis is a bit technical, but I think artists and architects are the same profession, if they’re good ones. Even doctors or politicians, they should have vision and they should understand human behaviour and try to offer possibilities for surviving intellectually or physically. Alexandra Pringle\nGroup editor-in-chief of Bloomsbury publishers How can art help the plight of refugees?\nArt helps human consciousness, art is about individuals’ emotions or ideas or concepts relating to a larger cultural definition of who we are. And art can break boundaries: there’s no “refugees” or other names, even “terrorists”, we’re all human. Art tries to illustrate or explain the situation we are in. So in that sense art is dangerous because art doesn’t accept any kind of regulation or any kind of principle; instead you have to go to an unknown area. Art helps our human understanding of our situation. Words like “refugee” and “terrorist” are a simplification and those words destroy the humanity. Elif Shafak\nWriter After creating so many works of art that give voice to the voiceless across the world, I wonder what are the emotions that you find easier to think, write or express in Chinese and what are the emotions you find easier to think, write or express in English? I am curious what is your relationship with each language, and how do they differ, if at all, emotionally.\nFor Chinese readers, the sensitivity and storytelling about common feelings and people’s everyday behaviour are the most effective. For western readers, since I was not raised in the west, my arguments are more about matters of ethics and philosophy. Rationality is easier for any audience to understand. Lord Alf Dubs\nPolitician What steps do you think can we take to persuade European public opinion to be more sympathetic to taking in refugees, especially in Britain?\nIt’s not possible to persuade anybody. You can only warn people what the consequences will be of not doing it. The idea of helping the unfortunate has always existed in most religionsIt’s easy to understand but I don’t think people will do it in practice. So, in my work, I’d rather warn about wh at will happen if we are not more sympathetic towards refugees. And that’s what I’m doing.

But I’m very fortunate I committed to fighting China because China is the ideal opponent. He never dies, you cannot beat him with one punch. So it is my life’s work. You mostly look unhappy. Are you happy, Mr Weiwei?\nUwe Wache, Germany\nI am the happiest person with the saddest face on Earth. Where did all the sesame seeds go? Can I get some?\nNick, Spain\nAh, the sunflower seeds? Yes, give me your address I will send you one. They are for someone who doesn’t mind seeing a dentist, because they will break their teeth on them! But seriously, in China, all the activists love these seeds, they call them the seeds of freedom. So we’ve sent out a few million seeds. It’s very costly, but they give them to their loved ones as wedding or engagement presents. They make a little earring or something. They really love them. I don’t know why. How did you and your family survive living in a hole in the ground for five years?\nAnne Gray, UK\nWe survived and had many happy moments in that hole [during the cultural revolution, Ai’s family had to live in an underground cavern previously used for farm animals]. We had the kind of happiness one will never experience living on Park Avenue or in some kind of palace. Ai Weiwei’s 2010 Turbine Hall installation at Tate Modern, London.

As soon as you start to fight – you can be the weakest or strongest – you have won. Of course, it’s very hard to win against a communist regime, but you never die if you keep fighting. So it’s like me: am I winning? I think in a certain way I’m impactful. But I’ll get old, I will die and who cares? Of all of your accomplishments, artistic and political, what are you personally most proud of? \nVincent Elliott, Canada\nI’m proud that I retain a clear mind with sensitivity and judgment. If there is one honour I’d love, it’s to be known as a clear-minded man. Some of my work is more popular, some less, but that is not so important. You make an effort, that’s the most important thing. I think anybody who wants to make the effort can create better work than me. Has becoming a parent had an impact on your art?\nLorraine Pink, Australia\nOh yes, definitely it helps me. Whatever I did before is like half of the circle; becoming a parent makes the circle full. So it’s very important for me, even if I understand very little about doing it. But still, it’s a gift, so you accept that gift. Also, it’s only when you become a parent you understand your own parents. That’s important, too.

You believe German society is intolerant to refugees – what has led you to that conclusion?\nSamuel Worz, Germany\nI have undergone a long period of study and research on this issue. German intolerance is not simply my impression, but a view formed by observing the German response to many different issues. Germany has failed not only when it comes to supporting refugees, but also on other political issues, such as dealing with authoritarian states like China. It has shown indifference to the struggle for democracy in Hong Kong. If you look at Germany’s pattern of responses to China, you can only conclude that most German politicians are not interested in ideology, but rather are focused on their own business interests. Does music inspire you, and if so what do you listen to?\nAnonymous, Japan\nNot at all! I wouldn’t say that I don’t like music, but I have never really turned on music in my life. I have good equipment, I have a lot of musician friends and I have perfect understanding of music. I can analyse music with my musician friends and conductors and they say: “You understand music so well!” But it’s like a parallel world in which I’m an alien. When I listen to it, I can rationalise happy emotions, but I don’t like music. I like silence. No sound at all. Maybe I belong to death. Last year you bought 30 tons of buttons from A Brown & Co when the business closed. What plans do you have for them?\nBill Brown, USA\nWhat a pain! We have started to analyse and measure and categorise them. We’re still working on that. At the moment, we don’t have a plan for them. We never do anything without totally understanding the situation, or at least thinking that we totally understand the situation. We want to find joy, then we can turn it into some other kind of joy. Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?\nIan Tinkler, Shetland\nI have no preference. I don’t see the difference between my opponents. What I am fighting is an ideology, which has no clear shape or size. Ai Weiwei’s artwork Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn, 1995. Photograph: © Ai Weiwei.\nAs a young man, you destroyed art and cultural artefacts. Do you still see those acts in the same way you did then?\nAmy Thompson, Mexico\nMy work has a solid understanding, but, at the same time, it happens intuitively. It cannot be repeated or clearly defined by the author. Do you enjoy cooking? What would you serve at a dinner party?\nNigel Simpson, UK\nYes, tremendously, mainly because my stomach is very sensitive, particularly to food. Cooking is relaxing. Cooking or cutting hair or whatever is a total break from other activities, and stops you getting burned out. What I cook depends on what’s there when I open the refrigerator. I always find something, but my cooking secret is that I cannot cook the same dish twice. I automatically avoid cooking anything the same. It doesn’t matter if it is such a good dish: “Can you redo it?” No, not possible. I see it as art. And I’m not the kind of artist that repeats the same work for 20 years.\n Topics You ask the questions Art Protest Imperial War Museums features.\nReuse this content \n", "label": [[40, 49, "ARTIST"], [67, 77, "DATE"], [85, 91, "GPE"], [325, 340, "DATE"], [368, 383, "DATE"], [395, 404, "ARTIST"], [496, 502, "GPE"], [753, 765, "DATE"], [841, 843, "ARTIST"], [849, 854, "GPE"], [855, 865, "DATE"], [1043, 1045, "ARTIST"], [1205, 1210, "GPE"], [1384, 1388, "DATE"], [1517, 1519, "ARTIST"], [1557, 1561, "DATE"], [1621, 1628, "GPE"], [1634, 1645, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1647, 1656, "DATE"], [1694, 1705, "GALLERY"], [2046, 2062, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2067, 2072, "GPE"], [2203, 2205, "ARTIST"], [2255, 2259, "DATE"], [2273, 2277, "DATE"], [2337, 2356, "MUSEUM"], [2357, 2363, "GPE"], [2473, 2497, "EVENT"], [2535, 2537, "ARTIST"], [3129, 3131, "ARTIST"], [3225, 3231, "GPE"], [3242, 3246, "DATE"], [3313, 3318, "GPE"], [3353, 3363, "DATE"], [3487, 3491, "DATE"], [3519, 3526, "GPE"], [3528, 3537, "ARTIST"], [3545, 3551, "GPE"], [3572, 3584, "ARTIST"], [3585, 3597, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3668, 3670, "ARTIST"], [3931, 3933, "ARTIST"], [4235, 4250, "ARTIST"], [4263, 4269, "ARTIST"], [4366, 4368, "ARTIST"], [4383, 4389, "ARTIST"], [4562, 4564, "ARTIST"], [4647, 4653, "GPE"], [4729, 4738, "GPE"], [4834, 4841, "GPE"], [5154, 5164, "ARTIST"], [5171, 5182, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5184, 5188, "DATE"], [5282, 5289, "GPE"], [5381, 5383, "ARTIST"], [5482, 5487, "GPE"], [5602, 5604, "ARTIST"], [5669, 5675, "GPE"], [5881, 5886, "GPE"], [6010, 6012, "ARTIST"], [6030, 6032, "GPE"], [6037, 6044, "GPE"], [6179, 6189, "DATE"], [6216, 6225, "GPE"], [6417, 6422, "GPE"], [6573, 6575, "ARTIST"], [6579, 6586, "GPE"], [6639, 6646, "GPE"], [6749, 6751, "ARTIST"], [6873, 6883, "DATE"], [7025, 7027, "ARTIST"], [7315, 7328, "CURATOR"], [7345, 7349, "GALLERY"], [7382, 7384, "GPE"], [7644, 7650, "GPE"], [7692, 7699, "GPE"], [7703, 7710, "GPE"], [7828, 7835, "GPE"], [8397, 8411, "ARTIST"], [8420, 8435, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8451, 8497, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8518, 8525, "ARTIST"], [8704, 8719, "WORK_OF_ART"], [9209, 9227, "CURATOR"], [9247, 9267, "GALLERY"], [9828, 9836, "DATE"], [9951, 9955, "DATE"], [10105, 10113, "DATE"], [10209, 10219, "CURATOR"], [10236, 10249, "MUSEUM"], [11394, 11405, "ARTIST"], [12240, 12247, "GPE"], [12766, 12786, "GPE"], [12893, 12898, "GPE"], [12938, 12945, "GPE"], [13018, 13023, "GPE"], [13032, 13037, "GPE"], [13180, 13186, "ARTIST"], [13199, 13206, "GPE"], [13321, 13326, "GPE"], [13518, 13523, "GPE"], [13882, 13892, "DATE"], [13894, 13903, "ARTIST"], [13905, 13907, "GPE"], [14181, 14190, "ARTIST"], [14193, 14197, "DATE"], [14227, 14238, "GALLERY"], [14240, 14246, "GPE"], [14305, 14314, "GPE"], [14349, 14358, "GPE"], [14804, 14819, "ARTIST"], [14821, 14827, "GPE"], [15222, 15235, "ARTIST"], [15237, 15246, "GPE"], [15596, 15601, "GPE"], [15624, 15631, "GPE"], [15673, 15675, "ARTIST"], [15759, 15763, "DATE"], [15764, 15779, "EVENT"], [15793, 15804, "ARTIST"], [15838, 15843, "GPE"], [15851, 15857, "GPE"], [15904, 15909, "GPE"], [16046, 16053, "GPE"], [16247, 16254, "GPE"], [16396, 16401, "GPE"], [16462, 16471, "GPE"], [16488, 16495, "GPE"], [16522, 16527, "GPE"], [16736, 16741, "GPE"], [17359, 17369, "ARTIST"], [17371, 17374, "GPE"], [17790, 17801, "ARTIST"], [17803, 17811, "GPE"], [17952, 17961, "ARTIST"], [17972, 17998, "WORK_OF_ART"], [18000, 18004, "DATE"], [18020, 18029, "ARTIST"], [18147, 18159, "ARTIST"], [18161, 18167, "GPE"], [18368, 18381, "ARTIST"], [18383, 18385, "GPE"], [18969, 18977, "DATE"], [19009, 19041, "WORK_OF_ART"]]}

Along with Martin Kippenberger and Georg Herold, Oehlen was a member of Berlin \"bad boy\" group.[6] Work[edit] Closely associated with the Cologne art scene, Oehlen was a member of the Lord Jim Lodge, along with Martin Kippenberger among others. His art is related to the Neue Wilde movement.[7] He has more recently been described as a 'free radical'.[8] Influenced by other German painters such as Georg Baselitz, Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter, Oehlen focuses on the process of painting itself.[9] During the 1980s he began combining abstract and figurative elements of painting in his works, as part of a reaction to the prevailing Neo-Expressionist aesthetic of the time.[3] In the following years, he worked within self-imposed, often absurd, parameters. He used only gray tones for his \"Grey\" paintings and limited himself to red, yellow, and blue for another series of what he calls \"bad\" paintings that included his infamous 1986 portrait of Adolf Hitler.[10] In his paintings of the late 1990s, each piece consists of smears and lines of paint Oehlen brushed and sprayed over collaged imagery that had been transferred to canvas by the type of gigantic inkjet printers used to manufacture billboards.[11] In 2002, Oehlen exhibited the \"Self-Portraits\" series which included eight self-portraits among them  Frühstück Now (Self-Portrait)(1984), Self-Portrait With Open Mouth (2001) and Self-Portrait as a Dutch Woman (1983).[12] In Oehlen's recent work, flat, figurative cut-outs-all the products of computer-aided design (CAD), and gestural strokes of oil paint trade places in the service of collage.[13] In his recent Finger Paintings, color-blocked advertisements are an extension of the canvas, providing fragmented, readymade surfaces for Oehlen's visceral markings, made with his hands, as well as brushes, rags, and spray-cans.[14] In 2014 Skarstedt Gallery, New York hosted Oehlen' \"Fabric Paintings\" exhibition, featuring fourteen of the twenty paintings made from 1992 to 1996, and mostly kept in his studio.[15] In 2015 Oehlen had his first major New York exhibition, \"Albert Oehlen: Home and Garden\" at the New Museum of Contemporary Art a self-portraits selection from 1980s and 1990s.[16] Music[edit] In the 1990s, Oehlen briefly ran his own independent label, Leiterwagen, putting out experimental electronica.[10] Since the late 1990s Oehlen has played in the bands Red Krayola and Van Oehlen. References to music are frequent in his paintings and drawings.[17] His artwork is on CDs by Gastr del Sol, Arthur Russell, and Brooklyn-based band Child Abuse.[10][dead link] Teaching[edit] Oehlen was Professor of Painting at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 2000 to 2009.[5] Personal life[edit] Oehlen is the brother of fellow artist Markus Oehlen, and their father is also an artist.[8] He lives with his wife, Esther Freund, and their three children in a village near Bühler.[10] Reception[edit] Criticism[edit] In 2013 ArtDaily described Oehlen as \"one of the most influential, but also one of the most controversial of contemporary painters\".[18] His paintings are also frequently compared with David Salle's.[19] However his work has not been met with universal approval. Philippe Dagen, writing in Le Monde about Oehlen's 2011 exhibition in Nîmes, concluded that he was \"of only limited importance. With about 30 canvases he reveals his system with absolute, but unfortunately appalling, clarity.\" His paintings were devoid of \"any form of expression or psychic density\".[20] His 2007 painting, Loa, is now part of the UK's Tate Collection.[21] Art market[edit] The Galerie Max Hetzler gave Oehlen his first solo show in 1981.[10] At a 2014 Christie's auction in London, one of Oehlen's self-portraits from 1984 was sold for $1.8 million, roughly three times its $670,000 high estimate.[22] At a March 2017 Christie's auction, Albert's \"Self Portrait with Palette\" sold for $3,623,230.[23] In 2019, at a June Sotheby's auction in London, \"self-portrait with empty hands\" sold to dealer Per Skarstedt for $7,542,157, a new record for the artist.[citation needed] Exhibitions[edit] Oehlen has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including I Will Always Champion Good Painting at Whitechapel Art Gallery in London (2006), Grounswell at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (2005), Provins – Legende at Museet for Samtidskunst[24] in Roskilde, Denmark and Spiegelbilder 1982–1985 at Max Hetzler gallery in Berlin (2005). In 2013 a retrospective of his entire oeuvre from the 1980s to 2005 consisting of over 80 works was held at MUMOK, Vienna.[18] Oehlen's work was included in the 2013 Venice Biennale.[25] A survey of more than 30 years of work was exhibited at the Cleveland Museum of Art from 4 December 2016 until 12 March 2017.

Featuring twenty new works, grouped by the prefixes u.b.B. (unverständliche braune Bilder) and Ö-Norm, the paintings on view at Galerie Max Hetzler are works on canvas, with one painted on aluminium Dibond. As the title, ‘incomprehensible brown pictures’, suggests, earthy pigments predominate, evoking the colours of Cubism, or of artists painting at the time, such as Francis Picabia. Yet many other colours feature too, ranging from vibrant pinks and primaries to greens, greys and ethereal washes of sky blue. All of the paintings contain white within them, bringing depth to the works and a luminosity to the show. Techniques abound, from heavy dripping, spraying and smearing to delicate washes of rag-blur or sfumato, demonstrating the artist’s unrestrained approach to painting. Caught between flatness and depth, structure and formlessness, the works contrast areas of painterly intricacy with expressive sabotage, revealing an inimitable range of paint handling techniques, unique to the artist. Oehlen produced his first abstract paintings in the late 1980s, with iconoclastic intent, in the hope of denouncing the inadequacy of painting; by the early 1990s, his paintings were incorporating ambiguous shapes and flashes of colour, that have since become a hallmark of his oeuvre. Whilst the u.b.B works share similarities with these earlier abstractions, which he described at the time as ‘post-non-representational’, they contain far less impasto, appearing more subtle and smooth, with hazy, transparent layers yielding further ambiguities. In some works, carefully painted details contrast with sparse, unpainted areas, peppered with paint, evoking the dynamism of action painting, whilst in others, the back of a figure is suggested, with long hair and arms raised. The continued importance of the line in Oehlen’s oeuvre can be traced throughout the exhibition, appearing at once curvy and controlled, freehand and stencilled. In the Ö-Norm paintings, we are reminded of the often-eccentric lines found in the artist’s ‘Tree Paintings’, which likewise stretch freely to the edges of their supports. In the first painting from this group, a grid remains visible in the background, endowing it with a rough, unfinished quality, which accentuates a further tension in Oehlen’s work, between elegance and abjection. The artist has repeatedly produced bodies of work that utilise the methods and aesthetics of collage, by combining such materials as advertising posters or printed fabric, with transparent veils of overpainting. Three of the paintings on view incorporate old exhibition posters, cut-out images and fragments of text, evoking his earlier ‘Billboard Paintings’, whilst also continuing to ridicule the abstract/figurative dualism. In this way, the new works remix motifs and techniques from the artist’s iconoclastic practice, whilst also pushing in new directions with surface, colour and line, cementing Oehlen’s reputation for subverting the conventions of the medium. Here, painting is presented as an area of heterogeneity and tension, in which the possibilities and value of self-expression, artistic authenticity, and even, the act of painting itself, undergo relentless re-assessment. Albert Oehlen (*1954, Krefeld), lives and works in Switzerland. Since 1981, he has been exhibiting regularly at Galerie Max Hetzler. Oehlen’s work has been shown in numerous solo exhibitions in international institutions, such as Serpentine Gallery, London (2019–2020); Palazzo Grassi, Venice (2018–2019); Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Havana (2017); The Cleveland Museum of Art and Guggenheim, Bilbao (2016); New Museum, New York and Kunsthalle Zürich (2015); Museum Wiesbaden (2014); mumok, Vienna (2013); Kunstmuseum Bonn (2012); Carré d’Art de Nîmes (2011); Musée d’art moderne de la Ville de Paris (2009); Whitechapel Gallery, London (2006); MOCA, Miami and Kunsthalle Nürnberg, Nuremberg (2005); Musée Cantonal Des Beaux Arts, Lausanne, Domus Artium 2002, Salamanca and Secession, Vienna (2004), among others.

Wikipedia article References.\nAlbert Oehlen (born 1954 in Krefeld, West Germany) is a contemporary German artist. Oehlen lives and works in Bühler and Segovia. Born in Krefeld, West Germany, in 1954, Oehlen moved to Berlin in 1977, where he worked as a waiter and decorator with his friend, the artist Werner Büttner. He graduated from the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, in 1978. Along with Martin Kippenberger and Georg Herold, Oehlen was a member of Berlin \"bad boy\" group. Closely associated with the Cologne art scene, Oehlen was a member of the Lord Jim Lodge, along with Martin Kippenberger among others. His art is related to the Neue Wilde movement. He has more recently been described as a 'free radical'. Influenced by other German painters such as Georg Baselitz, Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter, Oehlen focuses on the process of painting itself. During the 1980s he began combining abstract and figurative elements of painting in his works, as part of a reaction to the prevailing Neo-Expressionist aesthetic of the time. In the following years, he worked within self-imposed, often absurd, parameters. He used only gray tones for his \"Grey\" paintings and limited himself to red, yellow, and blue for another series of what he calls \"bad\" paintings that included his infamous 1986 portrait of Adolf Hitler. In his paintings of the late 1990s, each piece consists of smears and lines of paint Oehlen brushed and sprayed over collaged imagery that had been transferred to canvas by the type of gigantic inkjet printers used to manufacture billboards. In 2002, Oehlen exhibited the \"Self-Portraits\" series which included eight self-portraits among them Frühstück Now (Self-Portrait)(1984), Self-Portrait With Open Mouth (2001) and Self-Portrait as a Dutch Woman (1983). In Oehlen's recent work, flat, figurative cut-outs-all the products of computer-aided design (CAD), and gestural strokes of oil paint trade places in the service of collage. In his recent Finger Paintings, color-blocked advertisements are an extension of the canvas, providing fragmented, readymade surfaces for Oehlen’s visceral markings, made with his hands, as well as brushes, rags, and spray-cans. In 2014 Skarstedt Gallery (London, U.K.) hosted Oehlen' \"Fabric Paintings\" exhibition, featuring fourteen of the twenty paintings made from 1992 to 1996, and mostly kept in his studio. In 2015 Oehlen had his first major New York exhibition, \"Albert Oehlen: Home and Garden\" at the New Museum of Contemporary Art a self-portraits selection from 1980s and 1990s. In the 1990s, Oehlen briefly ran his own independent label, Leiterwagen, putting out experimental electronica. Since the late 1990s Oehlen has played in the bands Red Krayola and Van Oehlen. References to music are frequent in his paintings and drawings. His artwork is on CDs by Gastr del Sol, Arthur Russell, and Swiss band Child Abuse. Oehlen was Professor of Painting at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 2000 to 2009. Oehlen is the brother of fellow artist Markus Oehlen, and their father is also an artist. He lives with his wife, Esther Freund, and their three children in a village near Bühler. In 2013 ArtDaily described Oehlen as \"one of the most influential, but also one of the most controversial of contemporary painters\". His paintings are also frequently compared with David Salle's. However his work has not been met with universal approval. Philippe Dagen, writing in Le Monde about Oehlen's 2011 exhibition in Nîmes, concluded that he was \"of only limited importance. With about 30 canvases he reveals his system with absolute, but unfortunately appalling, clarity.\" His paintings were devoid of \"any form of expression or psychic density\".

{"id": 74, "data": "Skip to Article 31 Alberto Giacometti strives toward 'Ultimate Figure' in powerful Cleveland Museum of Art exhibition.\n631 shares.\nBy Steven Litt, cleveland.com.\nCLEVELAND, Ohio — It’s tempting to view great art through the prism of contemporary events, and that’s especially true in the case of the Cleveland Museum of Art’s big spring exhibition on the work of Alberto Giacometti. A Swiss modernist who spent much of his career in 20th-century Paris, Giacometti is known chiefly for sculptures of gaunt, shell-shocked human figures that wander distractedly across city squares, alienated from themselves and each other amid the psychic wreckage of World War II and the prospect of nuclear annihilation in the Cold War. The angst embodied by Giacometti’s art seems particularly relevant following Russia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine, as Vladimir Putin’s troops bomb civilian targets and send millions of refugees fleeing to safety. Working in the decades between Hiroshima and the American buildup in the Vietnam War, Giacometti portrayed an emaciated, uprooted, and pock-marked humanity living in a world on the brink — a precarious state of existence at least partially reprised by the biggest land war in Europe since Hitler. \"Three Men Walking,\" 1948. Alberto GiacomettiArchives, Fondation Giacometti. © ESTATE BRASSAÏ – RMN-Grand Palais But the coincidence of the show’s timing with the invasion of Ukraine is just that. If the exhibition underscores some of the ways in which Giacometti’s work remains powerfully apropos now, it reveals others that are equally compelling, if not timeless. Being and nothingness In his devotion to the human figure, Giacometti sought to express what it means to be human and to be aware of the nothingness beyond existence — without any reassurances provided by religious faith. That, too, makes his work enduringly relevant, no matter the context. The ragged, wrinkled faces of Giacometti’s portraits, particularly those of his wife, Annette Arm, and his brother, Diego, embody a notion of beauty based on lived experience. Like the faces in Rembrandt’s late portraits and self-portraits, they bear signs of having struggled with hard choices. With piercing eyes, determined gazes, and deeply lined faces, they confront the mysteries of being alive, underscored by their rough, expressive surfaces, which radiate a vital sense of the artist’s restless, searching touch. “Bust of Annette VIII,’’ of 1962, part of a series Giacometti undertook before his death in 1966 at age 65, gazes intensely at the viewer, but also beyond, toward some imaginary horizon that remains beyond reach. The elongated proportions and abrupt leaps in scale in Giacometti’s art convey a sense of extreme pressures that alter the spaces surrounding the sculptures in ways that simply can’t be conveyed by a photograph. The installation of \"\nTall Thin Head,\" 1954. by Alberto Giacometti, at the Cleveland Museum of Art.Steven Litt, Cleveland.com These illusionary force fields can’t be understood on a printed page or a screen. They have to be experienced in person, and that, too, makes them deeply human. “Tall Thin Head,’’ 1954, portrays a distorted bust of a man whose mouth is open as if he were trying to speak. Compressed on both sides, he appears in both profile views like a face on a coin. But his eyes, nose, and mouth wrap weirdly around the front of the sculpture, creating a wafer-thin face squashed from both sides by some kind of invisible, crushing pressure. The sculpture, like others in the exhibition, suggests the presence of a distorting force field, like the gravitational lensing discovered by Einstein that bends light from distant stars as it passes around closer bodies, like our own sun, on the way to Earth. Among other things, Giacometti’s art appears to embody the era in which theories of relativity changed understandings of time and space forever. Contemporary spirits Giacometti’s art looks and feels particularly modern in part because he was close friends with existentialist philosophers including Jean-Paul Sartre, author of the movement’s key text, “Being and Nothingness,’' and Simone de Beauvoir, author of “The Second Sex,’' which attributed womens’ existential dilemma to gender-based inequities. The existentialists explored the capacity of individuals to exercise freedom and responsibility through action, creating anxiety and doubt over choice and meaning from moment to moment in an absurd, violent, and unjust world governed by chance. Giacometti was part of a fertile cultural scene in postwar Paris, documented avidly by photographers including Brassai, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Gordon Parks, who flocked to his tiny, poorly heated Montparnasse studio. There, they portrayed the craggy, hollow-cheeked artist as something of an embodiment of his own work. Examples of such images, on view in the exhibition, include Cartier-Bresson’s blurry shot of Giacometti at a gallery, smoking a cigarette as he moves a sculpture, walking quickly through space like his skinny, elongated “Striding Man I,’’ in the foreground. Alberto Giacometti, 1961\r© Henri Cartier-Bresson / Magnum Photos \r© Estate of Alberto Giacometti / Bildupphovsr‰tt 2020\r\rArchives, Fondation Giacometti. © ESTATE BRASSAÏ – RMN-Grand Palais Yet if Giacometti’s art seems synonymous with the existentialist moment, it also has a totemic, atavistic quality. His work evokes ancient Egyptian tomb sculptures, or perhaps Greek Cycladic idols, like the Cleveland Museum of Art’s 5,000-year-old “Stargazer.’’ It yearns after qualities that feel eternal, not just part of the modern era. Co-organized with the Fondation Giacometti in Paris, which manages the artist’s estate and owns extensive examples of his work, the exhibition emerged out of discussions with the Cleveland museum that started several years ago, led here by William Robinson, the Cleveland museum’s senior curator of modern art. With more than 100 paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints, the show is based on the premise is that American audiences should be reintroduced to one of the major figures of modern European art after decades in which his work hasn’t received much attention, particularly beyond major East and West coast institutions. Since the 1970s, there have only been a handful of exhibitions in the U.S. devoted to Giacometti, including one that appeared in Cleveland in 1974. Obsession with the body The main thrust of the new exhibition, which opened in Cleveland a week ago and will travel to the Seattle Art Museum; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, is to focus on the human figure as Giacometti’s all-consuming interest in the final two decades of his life, from 1945 to 1966. The show passes quickly over Giacometti’s exploration of Surrealism in the 1930s when he developed a vocabulary of abstract forms that earned the praise of Andre Breton and other leaders of the movement. Giacometti suffered rejection by Breton after he returned to sculpting the human figure from live models later in the 1930s, but in a way, he was returning to his roots, as the show demonstrates. Early in his career, Giacometti developed notions of three-dimensional space that surfaced in landscapes he painted in his native Switzerland. Those little-known connections are thoroughly explored in the exhibition, illustrating his development with an unexpected depth. \"The Mountain Road,\" c. 1919. Alberto GiacomettiArchives, Fondation Giacometti. © ESTATE BRASSAÏ – RMN-Grand Palais Born in a mountain village in Switzerland northeast of Milan, Italy, and a few miles north of the Italian border, Giacometti was the first son of the important late 19th- and early 20th-century post-Impressionist painter Giovanni Giacometti. After enrolling in art academies in Geneva in 1919, the younger Giacometti settled in Paris in 1922 to study sculpture. He spent most of his life there, rarely traveling apart from a sojourn in Switzerland during the Nazi occupation of World War II. As the exhibition indicates, Giacometti’s early facility with landscape hinted at his later explorations of sculptural space and form. In a 1919 sketch of mountain meadows near Stampa, where he grew up, Giacometti pressed his ink pen heavily into the paper at places where stands of trees meet a meadow on a hillside, thickening his line there. It’s as if he were exploring the scene not just optically, but through touch, feeling his way along the curves, hollows, and seams of the landscape. The same sense of physical touch characterizes the luminous oil painting, “Mountain at Stampa,’’ 1917-20. Shining from behind him, orange-amber sunlight appears to flatten an Alpine peak. But Giacometti sharply indicates a cleft near the summit where the sun casts a sharp shadow, slicing into a solid mass and creating a sense of three-dimensionality. The exhibition’s text panels and labels emphasize the ways in which the sometimes bulbous bodies in Giacometti’s sculptures echo the mountain shapes he painted as a youth. But the cleft in the mountain summit at Stampa also anticipates the ways in which Giacometti came to describe facial features with a precise, cutting intensity. He used his brush as a young artist the way he would later dig into clay with a penknife to sculpt the intensely three-dimensional faces of his figures – a technique captured beautifully in a short film on display in the show, documenting the mature Giacometti at work in his studio. Constant draftsman Drawing is another major continuity in the show. The exhibition is filled with works on paper, including Giacometti’s numerous, obsessive studies of human heads and bodies, often sketched with a ballpoint pen on anything that came to hand, including exhibition fliers and newspapers. Giacometti also filled the plaster walls of his studio, with graffiti-like sketches. A fragment is displayed in the exhibition, like a relic from some ancient Pompeiian villa. \"Sketch for The Cage, First Version, Sketch for Four Figurines on a Stand, Sketches for The Chariot (Two Facing and One Profile),\" c. 1949–50. Alberto GiacomettiArchives, Fondation Giacometti. © ESTATE BRASSAÏ – RMN-Grand Palais Scale is another significant factor in Giacometti’s art. It comes as something of a shock to see how small and intimate much of it is, especially after decades in which artists have seemed to equate size with ambition. Working in a cramped, affordable space, Giacometti made numerous objects resembling amulets or trinkets buried in ancient tombs that are small enough to be carried in a pocket. His drawings, with their searching, hazily indicated outlines, have the delicacy of lace. Dominated by pale gray walls, the show may strike some viewers as visually dry, in part because of Giacometti’s inherent austerity, and because his work needs to be seen up close, instead of from across a room. Shock and drama But the show possesses an undeniable drama. Walls painted in somber tones of plum or oxide green resonate with the patinas of Giacometti’s bronzes. And, there are moments of shock. A sequence of portrait heads sculpted from the mid-1920s through the 1940s explores styles that evoke the Cubism of artists such as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, or the romantic and expressionistic qualities of Antoine Bourdelle, one of Giacometti’s instructors. But the series concludes with a strikingly elongated 1946 head of Marie-Laure de Noailles, a visual jolt that encapsulates the artist’s leap to his late, mature style. \"Head of Marie-Laure de Noailles on a Double Base,'' by Alberto Giacometti, 1946.Steven Litt, Cleveland.com Also shocking is the museum’s installation of “The Nose,’’ one of Giacometti’s most famous works. You suddenly encounter it in a corner upon entering the show’s big, final gallery. As you turn to see it, it’s like locking eyes with someone who’s been staring at you without your knowledge. \"The Nose,'' 1947-49, by Alberto Giacometti.Steven Litt, Cleveland.com The sculpture depicts a decapitated head with an obscenely long nose, suspended in a cage while shrieking in pain or cackling with wicked laughter — it’s hard to tell which. After working in smaller scales and formats through much of his career, Giacometti entertained a commission in to create site-specific sculptures for the plaza of the Chase Manhattan Bank office designed for lower Manhattan by architect Gordon Bunshaft. Two monumental sculptures developed for the plaza — a striding man and a totemic woman — conclude the exhibition with a bang. They were never installed; Giacometti, according to the exhibition’s catalog, wasn’t sure they’d work. He was reaching for the big, brash scale typical of New York, which was then rising as the capital of the art world, but Giacometti didn’t make the leap.

Skowhegan exposed him to painting from life, which would prove pivotal in his development as a painter and remains a staple of his practices today. Katz explains that Skowhegan's plein air painting gave him \"a reason to devote my life to painting.\"[4] Every year from early June to mid-September, Katz moves from his SoHo loft to a 19th-century clapboard farmhouse in Lincolnville, Maine.[5] A summer resident of Lincolnville since 1954, he has developed a close relationship with local Colby College.[citation needed] From 1954 to 1960, he made a number of small collages of still lifes, Maine landscapes, and small figures.[6] He met Ada Del Moro, who had studied biology at New York University, at a gallery opening in 1957.[2] In 1960, Katz had his first (and only) son, Vincent Katz. Vincent Katz had two sons, Isaac and Oliver, who have been the subjects of Katz's paintings. Katz has admitted to destroying a thousand paintings during his first ten years as a painter in order to find his style. Since the 1950s, he worked to create art more freely in the sense that he tried to paint \"faster than [he] can think.\"[7] His works seem simple, but according to Katz they are more reductive, which is fitting to his personality.[8] \"(The) one thing I don't want to do is things already done. As for particular subject matter, I don't like narratives, basically.\"[9] Work[edit] Katz achieved great public prominence in the 1980s.[10] He is well known for his large paintings, whose bold simplicity and heightened colors are now seen as precursors to Pop Art.[11] Artistic style[edit] Katz's paintings are divided almost equally into the genres of portraiture and landscape. Since the 1960s he has painted views of New York (especially his immediate surroundings in Soho) and landscapes of Maine, where he spends several months every year, as well as portraits of family members, artists, writers and New York society protagonists.[12] His paintings are defined by their flatness of colour and form, their economy of line, and their cool but seductive emotional detachment.[13] A key source of inspiration is the woodcuts produced by Japanese artist Kitagawa Utamaro.[14] In the early 1960s, influenced by films, television, and billboard advertising, Katz began painting large-scale paintings, often with dramatically cropped faces. Ada Katz, whom he married in 1958, has been the subject of over 250[15] portraits throughout his career.[16] To make one of his large works, Katz paints a small oil sketch of a subject on a masonite board; the sitting might take an hour and a half. He then makes a small, detailed drawing in pencil or charcoal, with the subject returning, perhaps, for the artist to make corrections. Katz next blows up the drawing into a \"cartoon\", sometimes using an overhead projector, and transfers it to an enormous canvas via \"pouncing\"—a technique used by Renaissance artists, involving powdered pigment pushed through tiny perforations pricked into the cartoon to recreate the composition on the surface to be painted. Katz pre-mixes all his colors and gets his brushes ready. Then he dives in and paints the canvas—12 feet (3.7 m) wide by 7 feet (2.1 m) high or even larger—in a session of six or seven hours. Beginning in the late 1950s, Katz developed a technique of painting on cut panels, first of wood, then aluminum, calling them \"cutouts\". These works would occupy space like sculptures, but their physicality is compressed into planes, as with paintings.[17] In later works, the cutouts are attached to wide, U-shaped aluminum stands, with a flickering, cinematic presence enhanced by warm spotlights. Most are close-ups, showing either front-and-back views of the same figure's head or figures who regard each other from opposite edges of the stand.[18] After 1964, Katz increasingly portrayed groups of figures. He would continue painting these complex groups into the 1970s, portraying the social world of painters, poets, critics, and other colleagues that surrounded him. He began designing sets and costumes for choreographer Paul Taylor in the early 1960s, and he has painted many images of dancers throughout the years. One Flight Up (1968) consists of more than 30 portraits of some of the leading lights of New York's intelligentsia during the late 1960s, such as the poet John Ashbery, the art critic Irving Sandler and the curator Henry Geldzahler, who championed Andy Warhol. Each portrait is painted using oils on both sides of a sliver of aluminum that has then been cut into the shape of the subject's head and shoulders. The silhouettes are arranged predominantly in four long rows on a plain metal table.[19] After his Whitney exhibition in 1974, Katz focused on landscapes, stating, \"I wanted to make an environmental landscape, where you were IN it.\"[20]  In the late 1980s, Katz took on a new subject in his work: fashion models in designer clothing, including Kate Moss and Christy Turlington.[4] \"I've always been interested in fashion because it's ephemeral,\" he said.[21] Printmaking[edit] In 1965, Katz also embarked on a prolific career in printmaking. Katz would go on to produce many editions in lithography, etching, silkscreen, woodcut and linoleum cut, producing over 400 print editions in his lifetime. The Albertina, Vienna, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, hold complete collections of Katz' print oeuvre. A print catalogue raisonné is due for release by the Albertina in the fall of 2011. Public commissions[edit] In 1977, Katz was asked to create a work to be produced in billboard format above Times Square, New York City. The work, which was located at 42nd Street and 7th Avenue, consisted of a frieze composed of 23 portrait heads of women. Each portrait measured 20 feet (6.1 m) high, and was based on a study Katz did from life. The billboard extended 247 feet (75 m) along two sides of the RKO General building and wrapped in three tiers above on a 60-foot (18 m) tower. Katz was commissioned in 1980 by the US General Services Administration's Art in Architecture Program to create an oil-on-canvas mural in the new United States Attorney's Building at Foley Square, New York City. The mural, inside the Silvio V. Mollo Building at Cardinal Hayes Place & Park Row, is 20 feet (6.1 m) high by 20 feet wide.[22] In 2005, Katz participated in a public art project titled \"Paint in the City\", commissioned by United Technologies Corporation and organized by Creative Time. Katz' work, titled Give Me Tomorrow, reached 28 feet (8.5 m) tall and 53 feet (16 m) long on a billboard space above the Bowery Bar. Located on the corner of the Bowery and East Fourth Street in the East Village, the work was hand painted by sign painters and was installed during the summer of 2005.[23] Collaborations[edit] Katz has collaborated with poets and writers since the 1960s, producing several notable editions such as \"Face of the Poet\"[24] combining his images with poetry from his circle, such as Ted Berrigan, Ann Lauterbach, Carter Ratcliff, and Gerard Malanga. He has worked with the poet John Ashbery, creating publications entitled \"Fragment\"[25] in 1966 and \"Coma Berenices\".[26] in 2005. He has worked with Vincent Katz on \"A Tremor in the Morning\"[27] and \"Swimming Home\".[28] Katz also made 25 etchings for the Arion Press edition of Gloria with 28 poems by Bill Berkson. Other collaborators include Robert Creeley, with whom he produced \"Edges\"[29] and \"Legeia: A Libretto\",[30] and Kenneth Koch, producing \"Interlocking Lives\".[31] In 1962, Harper's Bazaar incorporated numerous wooden cutouts by Katz for a four-page summer fashion spread. Numerous publications outline Katz's career's many facets: from Alex Katz in Maine[32] published by the Farnsworth Art Museum to the catalogue Alex Katz New York,[33] published by the Irish Museum of Modern Art. Alex Katz Seeing Drawing, Making,[34] published in 2008, describes Katz's multiple-stage process of first producing charcoal drawings, small oil studies, and large cartoons for placing the image on the canvas and the final painting of the canvas. In 2005, Phaidon Press published an illustrated survey, Alex Katz, by Carter Ratcliff, Robert Storr and Iwona Blazwick. In 1989, a special edition of Parkett was devoted to Katz, showing that he is now considered a major reference for younger painters and artists.[35] Over the years, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, Liam Gillick, Peter Halley, David Salle and Richard Prince have written essays about his work or conducted interviews with him.[36] Exhibitions[edit] Since 1951, Katz's work has been the subject of more than 200 solo exhibitions and nearly 500 group exhibitions throughout the United States and internationally.[3] Katz' first one-person show was an exhibition of paintings at the Roko Gallery in New York in 1954. In 1974 the Whitney Museum of American Art showed Alex Katz Prints, followed by a traveling retrospective exhibition of paintings and cutouts titled Alex Katz in 1986. The subject of over 200 solo exhibitions and nearly 500 group shows internationally, Katz has since been honored with numerous retrospectives at museums including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Brooklyn Museum, New York; the Jewish Museum, New York; the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; Colby College Museum of Art, Maine; Staatliche Kunsthalle, Baden-Baden; Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa, Venice; Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga; and the Saatchi Gallery, London (1998).[37] In 1998, a survey of Katz' landscape paintings was shown at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, featuring nearly 40 pared-down paintings of urban or pastoral motifs.[38] Katz is represented by Gavin Brown's Enterprise in New York, Timothy Taylor Gallery in London, and Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Paris/Salzburg. Before showing with Brown, he had been represented by Pace Gallery for 10 years and by Marlborough Gallery for 30 years.[39] The prints of Alex Katz are distributed in Europe by Galerie Frank Fluegel in Nuremberg. Collections[edit] Katz's work is in the collections of over 100 public institutions worldwide, including the Honolulu Museum of Art; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Cleveland Museum of Art; the Tate Gallery, London; the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tokyo; the Nationalgalerie, Berlin; and the Museum Brandhorst, Munich.[40] In 2010, Anthony d'Offay donated a group of works by Katz to the National Galleries of Scotland and the Tate; they are shown as part of the national touring programme, Artist Rooms.[41][42] In 2011, Katz donated Rush (1971), a series of 37 painted life-size cutout heads on aluminum, to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the piece is installed, frieze-like, in its own space.[43] Recognition[edit] Throughout his career, Katz has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for Painting in 1972, and in 1987, both Pratt Institute's Mary Buckley Award for Achievement and the Queens Museum of Art Award for Lifetime Achievement. The Chicago Bar Association honored Katz with the Award for Art in Public Places in 1985. In 1978, Katz received a U.S. government grant to participate in an educational and cultural exchange with the USSR.[44] Katz was awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship for Painting in 1972. Katz was inducted by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1988, and recognized with honorary doctorates by Colby College, Maine (1984), and Colgate University, Hamilton, New York (2005). In 1990 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994. He was named the Philip Morris Distinguished Artist at the American Academy in Berlin in 2001 and received the Cooper Union Annual Artist of the City Award in 2000. In addition to this honor, in 1994 Cooper Union Art School created the Alex Katz Visiting Chair in Painting with an endowment provided by the sale of ten paintings donated by the artist, a position first held by the painter and art critic Merlin James.[45] In 2005, Katz was the honored artist at the Chicago Humanities Festival's Inaugural Richard Gray Annual Visual Arts Series. In 2007, he was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Design, New York.[37] In October 1996, the Colby College Museum of Art opened a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) wing dedicated to Katz that features more than 400 oil paintings, collages, and prints donated by the artist.[46] In addition, he has purchased numerous pieces for the museum by artists such as Jennifer Bartlett, Chuck Close, Francesco Clemente, and Elizabeth Murray. In 2004, he curated a show at Colby of younger painters Elizabeth Peyton, Peter Doig and Merlin James, who work in the same figurative territory staked out by Katz.[2] In 1996, Vincent Katz and Vivien Bittencourt produced a video titled Alex Katz: Five Hours, documenting the production of his painting January 3,[47] and in 2008 he was the subject of a documentary directed by Heinz Peter Schwerfel, entitled What About Style? Alex Katz: a Painter's Painter. Legacy[edit] Katz' work is said to have influenced many painters, such as David Salle, Helena Wurzel, Peter Halley and Richard Prince,[13] as well as younger artists like Peter Doig, Julian Opie, Liam Gillick, Elizabeth Peyton, Barb Januszkiewicz, Johan Andersson,[19] and Brian Alfred.[15] Furthermore, it has become ubiquitous in advertising and graphic design.[citation needed] Notes and references[edit] ^ Snider, Suzanne, \"Why do Alex Katz's elegant canvases strike critics as the ultimate in WASP art?\", Tablet, A New Read on Jewish Life , November 21, 2006.\n^ a b c.\nCathleen McGuigan (August 2009), Alex Katz Is Cooler Than Ever Archived 2010-11-29 at the Wayback Machine Smithsonian Magazine .\n ^ a b.\nALEX KATZ: Selections from the Whitney Museum of American Art, June 29 - October 13, 2013 Archived September 29, 2013, at the Wayback Machine Nassau County Museum of Art , Roslyn Harbor.\n ^ a b.\nAlex Katz. \"Alex Katz\".

{"id": 99, "data": "Home Artist Alex Katz.\nAlex Katz Biography of Alex Katz Alex Katz is an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker celebrated for his figurative paintings. His works are instantly recognizable through their brightly colored, flattened style that was created in reaction to 1950s Abstract Expressionism. Despite being widely recognized for his role as a precursor to the Pop-Art movement, Alex Katz has avoided being affiliated with a singular style or movement throughout his career.  Born in New York in 1927, Alex Katz served in the Navy before attending art school where he developed his trademark style by experimenting with collaging paper. He has a varied oeuvre, ranging from large landscape paintings to figure studies, marine scenes, and flowers. However, Alex Katz is perhaps best known for his documentation of the people and social happenings that surround him. He takes his family and friends as his subjects, creating intimate painterly moments that often borrow visual techniques from advertising or cinema such as a repetition of features or cropping the scene. He is perhaps most well-known for his many portraits of his wife and muse, Ada.  Since 1951 Alex Katz’s work has been the subject of more than 200 solo exhibitions and nearly 500 group exhibitions internationally including shows at the Serpentine Gallery, London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1986) and the Brooklyn Museum of Art (1988) led to major exhibitions of Alex Katz’s landscape and portrait painting in Europe, the United States and Asia, and his work features in over 100 public collections worldwide.  The artist has received a steady stream of honors throughout his career, including a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy Museum, New York (2007); the Cooper Union Annual Artist of the City Award (2000); the Queens Museum of Art Award for Lifetime Achievement and an Award for Art in Public Places (1985), to name only a few. He currently lives and works in New York and Maine. .\nAvailable Works: 121.\nShare Facebook LinkedIn Pin it.\nArticles Alex Katz claims Warhol 'ripped him off' The Artists Who Influence Alex Katz fineartmultiple presents Alex Katz at the Kunsthalle Koidl Guillotined Queens, Beyonce & Power Plays at Berlin Art Week.\nArtworks & Prices Alex Katz Large Birch , 2004.\n View.\nAlex Katz Grey Ribbon, from the Alex And Ada Suite , 1980.\n View.\nAlex Katz Ariel , 2016.\n View.\nAlex Katz Red House , 2016.\n View.\nAlex Katz Sasha , 2016.\n View.\nAlex Katz Sasha 2 , 2016.\n View.\nAlex Katz Cityscape , 2016.\n View.\nAlex Katz Daniel , 2016.\n View.\nAlex Katz White Impatiens , 2015.\n View.\nAlex Katz Red Hat Ada , 2015.\n View.\nAlex Katz Black Dress 2 (Cecily) , 2015.\n View.\nAlex Katz Black Hat Ada , 2012.\n View.\nAlex Katz Sara , 2012.\n View.\nAlex Katz Sophie , 2012.\n View.\nAlex Katz Vivien , 2012.\n View.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n", "label": [[12, 21, "ARTIST"], [23, 32, "ARTIST"], [46, 55, "ARTIST"], [56, 65, "ARTIST"], [273, 278, "DATE"], [388, 397, "ARTIST"], [493, 501, "GPE"], [505, 509, "DATE"], [511, 520, "ARTIST"], [765, 774, "ARTIST"], [1165, 1169, "DATE"], [1170, 1179, "ARTIST"], [1314, 1332, "GALLERY"], [1334, 1340, "GPE"], [1349, 1375, "MUSEUM"], [1377, 1385, "GPE"], [1409, 1439, "MUSEUM"], [1441, 1445, "DATE"], [1455, 1470, "MUSEUM"], [1479, 1483, "DATE"], [1513, 1522, "ARTIST"], [1560, 1566, "GPE"], [1572, 1585, "GPE"], [1590, 1594, "GPE"], [1782, 1805, "MUSEUM"], [1807, 1815, "GPE"], [1817, 1821, "DATE"], [1874, 1878, "DATE"], [1976, 1980, "DATE"], [2035, 2043, "GPE"], [2048, 2053, "GPE"], [2120, 2129, "ARTIST"], [2137, 2143, "ARTIST"], [2187, 2196, "ARTIST"], [2222, 2231, "ARTIST"], [2239, 2274, "GALLERY"], [2301, 2316, "EVENT"], [2336, 2345, "ARTIST"], [2346, 2357, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2360, 2364, "DATE"], [2373, 2382, "ARTIST"], [2383, 2423, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2426, 2430, "DATE"], [2439, 2448, "ARTIST"], [2449, 2454, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2457, 2461, "DATE"], [2470, 2479, "ARTIST"], [2480, 2489, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2492, 2496, "DATE"], [2505, 2514, "ARTIST"], [2515, 2520, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2523, 2527, "DATE"], [2536, 2545, "ARTIST"], [2546, 2553, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2556, 2560, "DATE"], [2569, 2578, "ARTIST"], [2579, 2588, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2591, 2595, "DATE"], [2604, 2613, "ARTIST"], [2614, 2620, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2623, 2627, "DATE"], [2636, 2645, "ARTIST"], [2646, 2661, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2664, 2668, "DATE"], [2677, 2686, "ARTIST"], [2687, 2698, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2701, 2705, "DATE"], [2714, 2723, "ARTIST"], [2724, 2746, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2749, 2753, "DATE"], [2762, 2771, "ARTIST"], [2772, 2785, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2788, 2792, "DATE"], [2801, 2810, "ARTIST"], [2811, 2815, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2818, 2822, "DATE"], [2831, 2840, "ARTIST"], [2841, 2847, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2850, 2854, "DATE"], [2863, 2872, "ARTIST"], [2873, 2879, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2882, 2886, "DATE"]]}

And outside of that, it’s all pretty crappy,” says Alex Katz, over the phone from New York. The indefatigable 93-year-old artist has just released a new book with Rizzoli, another monograph. This one is larger and fuller than previous publications – there are more than 250 paintings, alongside photographs, sketches and ephemera; works by other artists, which give insight into Katz’s process and ethos; and an enjoyably thorough essay by the art critic Carter Ratcliff. The book is square and enormous. This heft suits Katz’s current mood as he focuses – sometimes angrily, sometimes humorously – on declaring that he is a brilliant painter who has been underappreciated and largely misunderstood. It’s true that Katz, while popular in Europe – “people wait outside my hotel for autographs” – and liked by the young, is not so adored in his home city of New York, where he has not had a major survey exhibition since the Whitney Museum retrospective in 1986 (although the Guggenheim recently announced plans to hold one in 2022). He is, unlike Cy Twombly or Jasper Johns, not considered a major artist in the way he would like, even though he is, by his own admission, “more popular now than I ever was”. While he is happy with this book – “it’s the one to beat” – he is not happy in general. “I’ll never be happy. I’m not sure what I’m doing. And I dislike most of the New York museums – I don’t think they have taken me seriously.” “Do you see yourself as an over-the-hill minor talent?” someone asked him a few years ago, during a trip to Spain. “I don’t, but a lot of other people do,” he says. This “conflict” with the institutions gets him down. Lawn Party, 1965 © Alex Katz. Collection of the Museum of Modern Art At the start of the pandemic, Katz spent three months in Pennsylvania, then three in Maine, where he has a house and where he studied, in the summer of 1949, at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. He is now back in the city, trying to avoid people, partly due to the pandemic and partly because he is picky about who he gives the time of day. “Any person on the planet can be interesting for five minutes. A lot of people are not interesting for 20 minutes. If you have dinner with a person, they have to be interesting for a couple of hours.” In the book, there are paintings of his circle of smart, creative friends, which has included the writers Kenneth Koch and Frank O’Hara, painter Fairfield Porter and dancers/choreographers Yvonne Rainer and Paul Taylor. There are triumphant blooming flowers and buildings and landscapes. And, of course, there is Ada, his wife, now 92, who he met in 1957, who he has painted hundreds of times and who is the subject of some of his best, and best-known, works. Ada and Vincent, 1967 © Alex Katz New York is going to be “a depressed place for a while”, he says. “The people eating in the streets are all kind of disgusting-looking. Bridge and Tunnel has taken over SoHo.” Can anyone be elegant during a pandemic? “I think so. Style never disappears, and neither does good taste.” Style and taste are key to Katz – in a subject, he looks at the lipstick, the handbag, the haircut. The smile. The neat black dress. The “artefacts of the culture”, as he puts it. Despite his grumblings, Katz does, in fact, know exactly what he is doing. With each painting he works to capture “the sensation of seeing things for the first time”. My paintings are serious and upbeat. But they are not clever In the book, Ratcliff calls Katz “an artist of the immediate”. Which is exactly right, Katz says. As much as people like to project all kinds of meaning onto his works, they are, he says, about the “immediate present” – not about politics or capitalism or commerce or Trump, but the brief, heavenly, ignorant moment when you look at something, glance without thinking, and just see. His paintings try to capture the flash of light, the visuals that strike the eye right then. The sensation of regarding someone across a room or on the street and seeing the mouth, the eyes, before recognising them – as your ex, your colleague, that girl from the movie. Or perhaps it’s like the emptiness of your head in the morning when you first wake up, before any memories set in. The moment when “you don’t understand the particulars, the details”, as Katz puts it. Islesboro Ferry Slip, 1975 © Alex Katz You could say something so surface-based was shallow, as some critics have. But Katz feels his works are justified because of skill, “the craft”, the way he makes paint sing. “I felt that [Franz] Kline and [Willem] de Kooning both painted in the now,” he says. “The impressionists were cumulative, they were not in the now.” He likes art that is “trying to get in the present tense”. That said, Katz believes his paintings are “fairly complicated. At different times they have different publics, and that’s the reason they are still around.” Some people, usually other artists, see the skill of his brushwork, the cleverness of the depth and his ability to capture light. Others, he says, see the subject matter, “the malleability of the images”. And then, “museums see things they can use to show to people. Dealers, something else.” According to Katz, any good painter has to offer these many things at once. “Very few painters hit them all and hold it for any length of time.” Vivien, 2017 © Alex Katz. Photography by Paul Takeuchi Katz is not remotely interested in the notion of the artist as activist. “We are in a time of hysterical ‘diversity’, is what they call it,” he says. Social art, as he refers to it, was big when he was in art school, and he is “very hostile to it. Social art to me is especially sentimental – you are telling people what to think. I’m doing stuff with flowers. That’s very abstract, it’s just the opposite. It’s got nothing to do with making society better.” While out of step with the vogue for culture as campaigning, Katz believes his paintings are currently bang on the money. “They never were before.” They stand up right now, he says, in a way that other works don’t. “When you go to a museum, you see the pop artists fading. They don’t hook up with the culture today at all. We’re in the pandemic. It’s no time for cleverness.” By contrast, his paintings “are serious and upbeat and escapist. But they are not ironic and they are not clever.” Passing, 1962-63 © Alex Katz. Museum of Modern Art, New York Why would one want to be on the money of the now – these strange, dystopian times, with the crumbling faith in politicians and institutions, the looming climate crisis, the inequality? Does he like the present? The question bounces off, like light. “I always like seeing the sun, the air in the morning. It’s the same as when I was 16. It hasn’t changed much.” Recommended How To Spend It Anthony Hopkins: ‘Act as if it is impossible to fail’.\n“The world is definitely more visual now than it’s ever been,” Katz says. He’s not sure if that’s a good thing, but rather that “there is no progress”. That sounds nihilistic. “Perhaps, but it seems to be going that way.” The writer Ann Beattie – who published a book on Katz’s work in 1987, positioning 26 of his paintings alongside text that tried to probe their psychological dimension – wrote that “it is difficult to look at some of Katz’s paintings and not imagine there must have been times when his powers of observation pained him.” Later, Katz admitted some of her analysis was true. Beattie notes Katz’s work often seems to show “people failing to connect”. Could there be a more apt description of the modern condition than a mass general failure to connect? A separateness, a loneliness, a rumbling anxiety despite all the technology. Kyla, 2020 © Alex Katz. West B’way Archive This is also Katz’s personal condition. He is, he says, never sure if people understand him. The new book is surprising in that it puts a focus on his biography – his Russian Jewish parents, his life as a first-generation immigrant child, his schoolboy hobbies. It seems odd to give weight to such things, when he’s been firm that his work is about the paint, the style, the technique – not some urgent inner truth, some story, something he’s bursting to say. Recommended Lunch with the FT Artist Alex Katz: ‘I’m 91, for Chrissakes, and I’m cranking out paintings’.\nBut, if he’s honest, he can draw a thread back to his childhood. When he was a boy, in Queens, he never felt at ease. There was just one other Jewish family living nearby. Though his parents tried to assimilate, they were dissimilar; the only ones with paintings in the house, they were “privately snobs, so we never became friends with the other Jewish family”. He was surrounded by difference, by other cultures. “I grew up in a neighbourhood with 24 houses. All were brand new, and the only thing people had in common was the price of the house. It made me uncomfortable – I felt everybody was better at everything than me. I guess that had a lot to do with my ambition and aggression.” Salute 4, 1962 © Alex Katz Feeling separate is usually good for creativity, I offer. And ego; ego is important to good work, and conviction. “Ego’s a big deal,” he says. “The ‘I’m right and you’re wrong’. Your energy impulse has to do with not feeling good. Like when you’re a teenager, you don’t feel good about yourself a lot of the time.” Teenagers, notoriously misunderstood, are unique in the strength of their faith in their hopes and dreams and passions. Feeling underappreciated or overlooked can motivate. “People have always been hostile to me. I think hostility is a big factor in staying alive as an artist.” If he’s still in a teenage state, he must feel young, I suggest. “I don’t know what young is.” He pauses. “I feel power when I paint, more than I did when I was young. I can watch my body decline, but when I paint I feel power. My father told me, ‘One day you’ll wake up and you’ll feel power all over you’, and I guess that happened. But the uncertainty stayed.” Alex Katz, edited by Vincent Katz with an essay by Carter Ratcliff, is published by Rizzoli priced at £115.\nGet alerts on Visual Arts when a new story is published.\nReuse this content (opens in new window).\nComments Jump to comments section.\nPromoted Content Follow the topics in this article Visual Arts Arts Alex Katz How To Spend It Lou Stoppard \n", "label": [[153, 162, "ARTIST"], [229, 231, "GPE"], [442, 451, "ARTIST"], [1021, 1030, "ARTIST"], [1052, 1060, "GPE"], [1349, 1353, "ARTIST"], [1491, 1495, "ARTIST"], [1685, 1689, "ARTIST"], [1708, 1714, "GPE"], [1826, 1834, "GPE"], [1893, 1907, "MUSEUM"], [1925, 1929, "DATE"], [1944, 1954, "MUSEUM"], [1995, 1999, "DATE"], [2016, 2026, "ARTIST"], [2030, 2042, "ARTIST"], [2342, 2350, "GPE"], [2514, 2519, "GPE"], [2624, 2634, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2636, 2640, "DATE"], [2643, 2652, "ARTIST"], [2672, 2692, "MUSEUM"], [2723, 2727, "ARTIST"], [2750, 2762, "GPE"], [2778, 2783, "GPE"], [2845, 2849, "DATE"], [3599, 3603, "DATE"], [3709, 3724, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3726, 3730, "DATE"], [3733, 3742, "ARTIST"], [3743, 3751, "GPE"], [3912, 3916, "GPE"], [4054, 4058, "ARTIST"], [4231, 4235, "ARTIST"], [4463, 4467, "ARTIST"], [4522, 4526, "ARTIST"], [5276, 5280, "ARTIST"], [5290, 5310, "WORK_OF_ART"], [5312, 5316, "DATE"], [5319, 5328, "ARTIST"], [5409, 5413, "ARTIST"], [5724, 5728, "ARTIST"], [6177, 6181, "ARTIST"], [6309, 6315, "WORK_OF_ART"], [6317, 6321, "DATE"], [6324, 6333, "ARTIST"], [6884, 6888, "ARTIST"], [7314, 7321, "WORK_OF_ART"], [7323, 7330, "DATE"], [7333, 7342, "ARTIST"], [7344, 7364, "MUSEUM"], [7366, 7374, "GPE"], [7882, 7886, "ARTIST"], [8090, 8094, "ARTIST"], [8105, 8109, "DATE"], [8257, 8261, "ARTIST"], [8368, 8372, "ARTIST"], [8427, 8431, "ARTIST"], [8667, 8671, "WORK_OF_ART"], [8673, 8677, "DATE"], [8680, 8689, "ARTIST"], [8723, 8728, "ARTIST"], [9207, 9216, "ARTIST"], [9363, 9369, "GPE"], [9966, 9974, "WORK_OF_ART"], [9976, 9980, "DATE"], [9983, 9992, "ARTIST"], [10951, 10960, "ARTIST"], [10972, 10984, "ARTIST"], [11053, 11057, "MONEY"], [11261, 11270, "ARTIST"]]}
{"id": 123, "data": "Alexander Calder Alexander Calder was an American sculptor and painter born in 1898 in Lawnton, Pennsylvania. In 1919, he received an engineering degree from Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey and from 1923 to 1925, he attended the Art Students League, New York. He lived and worked mostly in the United States and in France. He died in 1976 in New York city.  Calder is widely considered to be one of the most important American sculptors of the 20th century. He is best known for innovative kinetic sculptures powered by air currents, the \"mobiles\" and his colorful, whimsical abstract monumental sculptures, or \"stabile\". Although primarily known as a sculptor, Calder was a prodigious artist with a restless creative spirit, whose diverse practice included painting, mostly in gouache, and printmaking, miniatures (such as his famous Cirque Calder), children's book illustrations, theater set design, jewelry design, tapestries and rugs, and political posters.  Calder's public commissions are on view in cities all over the world and his work has been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions, including the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1998, traveled to San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, California); The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C. (1998–99); Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford (2000); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2000); Iwaki City Art Museum, Japan (2000, traveled to The Museum of Modern Art, Japan; Hokkaido Obihiro Museum of Art, Japan; The Museum of Art, Japan; Hiroshima Prefectural Art Museum, Japan; Nagoya City Art Museum, Japan); Storm King Art Center, New York (2001–03); Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao (2003, traveled to Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, through 2004); Foundation Beyeler, Switzerland (2004, traveled to Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C., through 2005); Los Angeles County Museum of Art, California (2013); Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (2014); Fondation Beyeler, Basel (2014); Museo Jumex, Mexico City (2015); and Pulitzer Arts Foundation, Saint Louis (2015).\n

Freedman Plaza.\nAbout Exhibition Location Media Gallery About the Artist.\nShare.\nAbout Exhibition Nature provided us with a general way to measure time: dividing it into days, lunar months, and seasons. Since ancient times, however, we have invented ways of measuring time in smaller units with ever-increasing precision – from the sundial to the hourglass to the atomic clock. As clock making technology advanced during the Renaissance, handsome public clocks became a source of civic pride, as well as a useful amenity. In today’s digital age, they more often evoke a sense of nostalgia for another era. In Against the Run, Alicja Kwade (b. 1979, Katowice, Poland) has created a clock that tells the correct time, but does so in a way that confounds expectations. Adapting a nineteenth-century design that we might typically see in New York City, the artist has reversed the conventional mechanism. The face of the clock rotates backwards while the second hand appears to stand still, pointing vertically at all times. Our understanding of how a clock should run is second nature, making this variation almost impossible to read, even as it continues to tell the right time. Kwade’s whimsical clock captures her interest in the systems we invent to make sense of our lives and the world. In doing so, it prompts us to see “reality” from a new perspective. This exhibition is curated by Nicholas Baume.\nLocation Location Doris C. Freedman Plaza Central Park, 60th Street & 5th Avenue.\nGet Directions.\nMedia Gallery About the Artist Alicja Kwade (b. 1979, Katowice, Poland) lives and works in Berlin.

Courtesy of the artist and i8 Gallery, Reykjavik Iceland may be better known for its natural beauty than its art scene, but the opening of a multidisciplinary art space in Reykjavik is set to bring a new gravitas to the capital city’s burgeoning standing in the art world. i8 Gallery, one of the most established art galleries in the Nordics, has opened an epic second space across the harbour from its existing location. The new i8 Grandi is located in the Marshall House, a cultural centre within a historic factory in the Grandi harbour district, which also houses the Living Art Museum, non-profit gallery Kling & Bang, as well as Olafur Eliasson’s private studio. Its two sprawling floors will be devoted to year-long exhibitions, each dedicated to a single artist. ‘I was involved in the transformation of the building from fishing factory to arts space in 2017, along with Ásmundur Hrafn Sturluson and Steinþór Kári Kárason of Kurtogpí Architects,’ recalls i8 Gallery’s co-founder Börkur Arnarson. ‘Taking inspiration from spaces such as the Löwenbräukunst in Zurich, we felt that Reykjavik could use a multipurpose arts space. In the almost five years the building has been open, I have considered its potential for various projects, and the idea of single-artist, long-term exhibitions is an exciting concept for i8 to embark upon in this space.’ i8 Grandi is located within the Marshall House, Reykjavik. Photography: by Ari Magg Courtesy of i8 Gallery, Reykjavik.\nThe gallery’s novel long-form presentation model is especially apt, given where the art world is today. ‘As the art world seems to only speed up, we thought it would be interesting to offer artists an opportunity to truly slow down. With a show spanning a calendar year, we can offer an exhibition that is on view for far longer than other gallery and museum shows,’ Arnarson explains. ‘Within that is a unique approach of shifting works during the exhibition: it will be fluid, sometimes growing and sometimes shrinking throughout the time on view. Local visitors can see multiple iterations of shows, and people who only get to Iceland once in the year will have a chance to experience a dedicated exhibition. This format allows all visitors, be it their first or fifth visit, to leave with a strong sense of the artist and their practice beyond what a typical gallery show is able to provide.’ i8 Grandi’s inaugural exhibition ‘In Relation to the Sun’ is by the Polish-born, Berlin-based artist Alicja Kwade, whom i8 Gallery has represented for a decade. Throughout the year, Kwade will reconfigure elements and adapt works in the show, emphasising her recurring themes of space, time, science and philosophy. The exhibition features key works including her mixed media installation Connectivity of Force Free Bodies Ouroboros (2010), as well as new works on paper and sculptures from the last year. Alicja Kwade, Connectivity of Force Free Bodies Ouroboros , 2010 mixed media. Courtesy of the artist and i8 Gallery, Reykjavik.\n‘[Alicja] was a natural fit to inaugurate our new space as her practice deals with issues of time, space, and conceptual considerations,’ says Arnarson. ‘She is a brilliant artist and has an incredible grasp of scale and form. i8 Grandi allows us to offer Alicja ample space to feature her sculptural installations, as she is particularly skilled in her approach to larger works.’ He concludes: ‘The ideas of space and time were intrinsically linked to i8 Grandi from the outset. The length of the exhibition lends [itself] to reflections on measurement, and, as so much of the world paused over the past two years, the consideration of time feels more relevant than ever.’ § Alicja Kwade, Connectivity of Force Free Bodies Ouroboros , 2010 mixed media.

{"id": 171, "data": "Alighiero Boetti Selected Works Biography Exhibitions Request Information.\n- Selected Works - Biography Alighiero Boetti (1940-1994) – or Alighiero e Boetti ( “e” means “and”) as the Artist signed his works from 1973 on  – was born in Turin, where he started his activity joining the Arte Povera movement in January 1967.  In 1972 he moved to Rome, where he discovered the pleasure of light and colours, far from the austerity of Turin. In 1971 he had discovered Afghanistan and in Kabul had started an artistic collaboration with women embroiderers, creating tapestries such as his political Maps which would evolve according to the world’s political mutations. As a conceptual and versatile artist, he has produced a great variety of artworks, delegating to other people the manual execution of some specific typologies, but in that case following very precise “rules of the game” and even high principles such as the 1971 Nobel Price Jacques Monod’s “Chance and necessity”. Among such pieces, the ballpoint pen Monochromes (blue, black, red, green) with a white coded writing coming out of the evenly doodled coloured surface; or the tapestries embroidered on cloth, not only the World Maps but also the multi-coloured “Magic Squares” of texts written in Italian and Persian as well as the “Tutto” (Everything), dense puzzles where indeed everything can be found ( newspaper silhouettes, figures of animals and shapes of domestic objects …) Other types of Boetti’s works are exclusively executed by his own hand: for example, his Postal Works that play on the mathematical permutation of different stamps, on the unpredictable adventure of a postal journey, and also (from 1980 on) on the hidden charm of written messages travelling inside the envelopes. Besides, also his early 1970s systematic ‘exercises’ by pencil on squared paper, based on musical and mathematical rhythms. And finally, throughout the 80s and 90s, here is his mixed technique on paper, in particular his colourful compositions with happy flocks of animals sliding along,  with an explicit reminiscence of Etruscan or Pompeian ornaments. The idea of time, with its fascinating and ineluctable passing by, probably is the unifying topic in Boetti’s typological and iconographical plurality. Among the last works some are monumental indeed, such as the fifty one tapestries with texts in Italian and Persian (shown in Paris, at ‘Les Magiciens de la Terre’ exhibition, 1989), or else the fifty kilims exposed at the Magasin in Grenoble in December 1993, which was the last exhibition inaugurated in presence of the Artist, yet very ill at that time. Alighiero Boetti exposed his works in the most prestigious and emblematic exhibitions of his generation, from ‘When Attitudes Become Form’ (1969) to ‘Contemporanea’ (Rome 1973), from ‘Identité Italienne’ (Paris, 1981) to ‘The Italian Metamorphosis 1943-1968’ (Guggenheim Museum New York, 1994). Works of his were exposed at six editions of the Venice Biennale ; his personal exhibition room in the 1990 edition was awarded a special prize, and a posthumous homage show was presented in the 2001 edition. Not only his works but his choices as an artist strongly influenced the generation of artists that followed and many young people of the new millennium, in Italy and in the world.\n (http://www.archivioalighieroboetti.it/eng/alighiero-boetti/).\n- Exhibitions 2019 Alighiero Boetti: Embroideries Including Mappas, Tuttos and a Rug - Ben Brown Fine Arts, London.\n2018 Alighiero Boetti.

Licensed by Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York Mexico City-based design gallery Masa has announced a new exhibition, ‘Elementos Vitales’ (until 15 December 2021), which will showcase five filmworks by Cuban-American artist Ana Mendieta (1948 – 1985), alongside installations from five architects, designers and artists. The exhibition, curated by Mexico City-based writer Su Wu, marks the first time these five films will be shown in Oaxaca, the state in which they were created. They follow Cuba-born Mendieta’s journey to Mexico and the establishment of her aesthetic, which explores the tangible and unconscious traces that we leave on the environment. Her films, including the first from her Silueta series, shot at the Yagul archaeological site in 1974, feature interactions – such as Mendieta’s carving, burning and embedding of her silhouette into her Oaxaca surroundings – exploring how time and consciousness can work together to shape the land.

The artist Ana Mendieta (1948–1985) is remembered as the creator of powerful works expressing a vibrant and unflinching second-wave feminist sensibility. In Radical Virtuosity, art historian Genevieve Hyacinthe offers a new view of Mendieta, connecting her innovative artwork to the art, cultural aesthetics and concerns, feminisms, and sociopolitical messages of the black Atlantic. Mendieta left Cuba as a preteen, fleeing the Castro regime, and spent years in U.S. foster care. Her sense of exile, Hyacinthe argues, colors her work. Hyacinthe examines the development of Mendieta's performative artworks—particularly the Silueta series (1973–1985), which documented the silhouette of her body in the earth over time (a series “without end,” Mendieta said)—and argues that these works were shaped by Mendieta's appropriation and reimagining of Afro-Cuban ritual. Mendieta's effort to create works that invited audience participation, Hyacinthe says, signals her interest in forging connections with the marginalized, particularly those of the black Atlantic and Global South. Hyacinthe describes the “counter entropy” of Mendieta's small-scale earthworks (contrasting them with more massive works created by Robert Smithson and other male artists); considers the resonance of Mendieta's work with the contemporary practices of black Atlantic female artists including Wangechi Mutu, Renee Green, and Damali Abrams; and connects Mendieta's artistic and political expressions to black Atlantic feminisms of such popular artists as Princess Nokia. Mendieta's life and work are often overshadowed in popular perception by her early and tragic death—at thirty-six, she plunged from the window of the thirty-fourth floor Greenwich Village apartment she shared with her husband, the artist Carl Andre. (Andre was charged with her murder and acquitted.) Hyacinthe's account—profusely illustrated, with many images in color—reclaims Mendieta's work and legacy for its artistic significance.\n Hardcover $39.95 T.\nISBN: 9780262042703.\n352 pp. | 6 in x 9 in.\n78 color illus., 16 b&w illus.

Hyperallergic.\n\"By showing how a black Atlantic frame challenges received notions about performance and transience, Hyacinthe has achieved not only a defining study about Mendieta which is as virtuosic as the artwork she describes, but moreover has produced a benchmark of black Atlantic art history. Where is Ana Mendieta? She is everywhere, if we know how to look. 'Radical Virtuosity' helps viewers to do so in fresh and vital ways.” ART HISTORY.\nEndorsements “This is one of those rare books that will surprise the reader.

Gene Swenson: Is that what Pop Art is all about? Andy Warhol: Yes, it's liking things. Quote in 'What is Pop Art? Answers from 8 Painters', in 'Art News' 62, November 1963.\nThe reason I'm painting this way is that I want to be a machine, and I feel that whatever I do and do machine-like is what I want to do. 'What is Pop Art? Answers from 8 Painters', Part 1, G. R. Swenson, in Art News 62, November 1963.\nThe farther West we drove [to California, Fall of 1963, with Gerard Malanga , Wynn Chamberlain , and Taylor Mead for an opening of Warhol's 'Liz & Elvis paintings' at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles], the more Pop everything looked on the highways. Suddenly we all felt like insiders because even though Pop was everywhere – that was the thing about it, most people still took it for granted, whereas we were dazzled by it – to us, it was the new Art. Once you 'got' Pop, you could never see a sign the same way again. And once you thought Pop, you could never see America the same way again. The moment you label something, you take a step – I mean, you can never go back again to seeing it unlabeled. We were seeing the future and we knew it for sure..  ..the mystery was gone, but the amazement was just starting. [quote in 1963] Quote in Warhol in his own words – Untitled Statements ( 1963 – 1987) , selected by Neil Printz; as quoted in Andy Warhol, retrospective , Art and Bullfinch Press / Little Brown, 1989, pp. 457 – 467.\nI think of myself as an American artist: I like it here..  .I feel I represent the U.S. in my art but I'm not a social critic. I just paint those things in my paintings because those things are the things I know best. I'm not trying to criticize the U.S. in any way, not trying to show up any ugliness at all. I'm just a pure artist, I guess. But I can't say if I take myself seriously as an artist. I just hadn't thought about it. I don't know how they consider me in print, though. Quote of Warhol in Andy, My true Story 3, Gretchen Berg , Los Angeles Free Press (17 March 1967); as quoted in Andy Warhol, retrospective , Art and Bullfinch Press / Little Brown, 1989, pp. 457 – 467.\nIf you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface; of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There's nothing behind it. In: Andy, My true Story 3, Gretchen Berg, Los Angeles Free Press (17 March 1967); as quoted in Andy Warhol, retrospective , New York and Boston Museum of modern Art & Bullfinch Press / Little Brown, 1989, pp. 457 – 67.\nIn the future everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes. Catalogue of an exhibition of his art in Stockholm, Sweden (1968) This quotation has produced a common cliché  about fame in pop-culture which is called \"15 minutes of fame\" ; it has often been paraphrased or misquoted in various ways, including:.\nIn the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes. In the future everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame.\nWhen asked about this quote, he would corrupt it intentionally, including: In the future, fifteen people will be famous. In fifteen minutes, everyone will be famous.\n Scripts bore me. It's much more exciting not to know what's going to happen. I don't think that plot is important. If you see a movie of two people talking, you can watch it over and over again without being bored. You get involved – you miss things – you come back to it ... But you can't see the same movie over again if it has a plot because you already know the ending ... Everyone is rich. Everyone is interesting. Years ago, people used to sit looking out of their windows at the street. Or on a park bench. They would stay for hours without being bored although nothing much was going on. This is my favorite theme in movie making – just watching something happening for two hours or so ... I still think it's nice to care about people. And Hollywood movies are uncaring. We're pop people. We took a tour of Universal Studios in Los Angeles and, inside and outside the place, it was very difficult to tell what was real. They're not-real people trying to say something. And we're real people not trying to say anything. I just like everybody and I believe in everything. Warhol explained that the lack of a plot in Blue Movie was intentional (1969).\nAs quoted by Victor Bockris in his book, Warhol: the Biography (2003), p. 327 . Bockris, Victor (August 12, 2003). Warhol: the Biography . p. 327 . Retrieved on October 31, 2019 .\n.\nWhat Is Pop Art? Interviews with Eight Painters, Part 1 (1963)[edit] Quotes of Andy Warhol in 'What Is Pop Art?, by Gene Swenson - 'Interviews with Eight Painters (Part 1)', Art News 62, New York, November 1963; reprinted in Pop Art Redefined, John Russell and Suzi Gablik (eds.), London, 1969 It's hard to be creative and it's also hard not to think what you do is creative or hard not to be called creative because everybody is always talking about that and individuality. Everybody's always creative. And it is so funny when you say things aren't, like the shoe I would draw for an advertisement was called a 'creation', but the drawing of it was not..  .There are millions of actors. They're all pretty good. And how many painters are there? Millions of painters and all pretty good. How can you say one style is better then another. You ought to be able to be an Abstract-expressionist next week, or a Pop artist, or a realist, without feeling you're given up something. pp. 116-19.\nIf an artist can't do anymore, then he should just quit; and an artist ought to be able to change his style without feeling bad. I heard that Lichtenstein said he might not be painting comic strips a year of two from now [1963]. I think that would be so great, to be able to change styles. And I think that's what's going to happen; that's going to be the whole new scene. pp. 116-19.\nWe went to see 'Dr No' [first James Bond film, 1962] at Fort-Second Street. It's a fantastic movie, so cool. We walked outside and somebody threw a cherry bomb right in front of us, in this big crowd. And there was blood. I saw blood on people and all over. I felt like I was bleeding all over. I saw in the paper last week that there are more people throwing them - it's just part of the scene - and hurting people. My show in Paris is to be called 'Death in America'. I'll show the 'Electric-chair' pictures and the Dogs in Birmingham and car wrecks and some suicide pictures. pp. 116-19.\nI guess it was the big plane crash picture [why Warhol started his 'Death'-series], the front page of a newspaper: '129 DIED'. I was also painting the Marilyns [the Marylin Monroe portraits, Warhol started after her tragic death in 1962] I realized that everything I was doing must have been Death. It was Christmas or Labor Day - a holiday - and every time that you turned on the radio they said something like '4 millions are going to die'. That started it. But when you see a gruesome picture over and over again, it doesn't really have any effect. pp. 116-19.\nI started those [the ' Elisabeth Taylor ' pictures, Warhol made from a publicity photo of her 1960 film ' BUtterfield 8 a long time ago when she was so sick and everybody said she was going to die [but she recovered]. Now I'm doing them all over, putting bright colors on her lips and eyes. My next series will be pornographic pictures, they will look blank; when you turn on the black lights, then you will see them - big breast and.. .If a cop came in, then you could just flick out the lights or turn to the regular lights. How could you say that was pornography?.  .. Segal did a sculpture of two people making love, but he cut it all up, I guess because he thought it was too pornographic to be art..  .The thing I like about it is that it makes you forget about style and that sort of things; style isn't really important. pp. 116-19.\nThe name [Pop] sounds so awful. Dada must have something to do with Pop. it's so funny, the names are really synonyms. Does anyone know what they're supposed to mean or have to do with, those names? Johns and Rauschenberg , Neo-Dada for all those years, and everyone calling them derivative and unable to transform the things they use, are now called progenitors of Pop . It's funny the way things change. I think John Cage has been very influential, and Merce Cunningham too, I think..  ..History books are being rewritten all the time. pp. 116-19.\nElectric chair quote[edit] Warhol's electric chair quote (date not established) is found in many books with variations. The earliest and most reported version is: You'd be surprised how many people want to hang an electric chair on their living-room wall. Specially if the background color matches the drapes. As quoted in Moderna Museet (1968), Andy Warhol: Stockholm, Moderna Museet, February–March 1968 (exhib. cat.), Malmö: Sydsvenska Dagbladets, [ISBN]; repr. 1970, Boston: Boston Book and Art, [ISBN].\nAs quoted in Mike Wrenn (1991), Andy Warhol: In His Own Words , London & New York: Omnibus Press [Music Sales Group], ISBN 0-7119-2400-7 [[[Special:BookSources/978-0-7119-2400-0| ISBN 978-0-7119-2400-0 ]]].\nAs quoted in Isabel Kühl (2007), Andy Warhol: Living Art , Munich & New York: Prestel, ISBN 978-3-7913-3814-9 [[[Special:BookSources/3-7913-3814-5| ISBN 3-7913-3814-5 ]]].\nCommon variants include: (You'd be surprised who'll hang an electric chair in the living room. Especially if the background matches the drapes.) As quoted in Jan Greenberg, Sandra Jordan (2004), Andy Warhol: Prince of Pop , New York: Delacorte, ISBN 0-385-90079-1 [[[Special:BookSources/978-0-385-90079-9| ISBN 978-0-385-90079-9 ]]].\nAdditional variants with \"curtains\" for \"drapes\" came by way of French translations being re-translated back into English for bilingual books or exhibition notices: (You wouldn't believe how many people will hang up a picture of an electric chair? especially if it matches the color of their curtains.) As quoted in Sylvie Fleury et al. (2001), Sylvie Fleury: Identity, Pain, Astral Projection (exhib. cat., Magasin, Grenoble, France, 2001–2002), Paris: RMN (Réunion des musées nationaux) & Dijon: Presses du réel, ISBN 2-7118-4313-0 [[[Special:BookSources/978-2-7118-4313-8| ISBN 978-2-7118-4313-8 ]]].\n(You wouldn't believe how many people will hang a picture of an electric chair in their room – especially if the color of the picture matches the curtains.) As quoted in Geoff Nicholson (2002), Andy Warhol: A Beginner's Guide , London: Hodder & Stoughton, ISBN 0-340-84620-8 [[[Special:BookSources/978-0-340-84620-9| ISBN 978-0-340-84620-9 ]]].\n(You wouldn't believe the number of people who hang the electric chair painting in the homes, especially if the colour of the canvas matches the curtains.) As quoted in Marie Deparis (2009), \"Mounir Fatmi: Gardons Espoir / Keeping Faith\" (bilingual exhibition notice, as a retranslation from the French \"On n'imagine pas le nombre de personnes qui accrocheraient chez elles le tableau de la chaise électrique, surtout si les coloris de la toile s'harmonisent avec les rideaux.\").\n1970s[edit] If you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface; of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There's nothing behind it..  .I see everything that way, the surface of things, a kind of mental Braille. I just pass my hands over the surface of things. [1973] In: Warhol in his own words – Untitled Statements ( 1963 – 1987) , selected by Neil Printz; as quoted in Andy Warhol, retrospective , Art and Bullfinch Press / Little Brown, 1989, pp. 457 – 467.\nWhy do people think artists are special? It's just another job. In: Philosophy of Andy Warhol , Andy Warhol, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York, 1975, p. 178.\nIt's the place where my prediction from the sixties finally came true: \"In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes.\" I'm bored with that line. I never use it anymore. My new line is, \"In fifteen minutes everybody will be famous.\" Andy Warhol's Exposures (1979) commenting on the nightclub \"Studio 54\", and his world famous quote.\n The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (1975)[edit] Quotes from The Philosophy of Andy Warhol : (From A to B and Back Again).\n, 1975 ISBN 978-0156717205.\nAt the times in my life when I was feeling the most gregarious and looking for bosom friendships, I couldn't find any takers so that exactly when I was alone was when I felt the most like not being alone. The moment I decided I'd rather be alone and not have anyone telling me their problems, everybody I'd never even seen before in my life started running after me to tell me things I'd just decided I didn't think it was a good idea to hear about. As soon as I became a loner in my own mind, that's when I got what you might call a \"following.\" As soon as you stop wanting something you get it. I've found that to be absolutely axiomatic. Ch. 1: Puberty.\nDuring the 60's, I think, people forgot what emotions were supposed to be. And I don't think they've ever remembered. I think that once you see emotions from a certain angle you can never think of them as real again. That's what more or less has happened to me. I don't really know if I was ever capable of love, but after the '60's I never thought in terms of \"love\" again. Ch. 1: Puberty.\nI don't see anything wrong with being alone, it feels great to me. People make a big thing about personal love. It doesn't have to be such a big thing. The same for living - people make a big thing about that too. But personal living and personal loving are the two things the Eastern-type wise men don't think about. Ch. 3: Senility.\nI love every \"lib\" movement there is, because after the \"lib\" the things that were always a mystique become understandable and boring, and then nobody has to feel left out if they're not part of what is happening. For instance, single people looking for husbands and wives used to feel left out because the image marriage had in the old days was so wonderful. w:Jane Wyatt and Robert Young. w:Nick and Nora Charles , Ethel and Fred Mertz, Dagwood and Blondie. Ch. 3: Senility.\nWhat I was actually trying to do in my early movies was show how people can meet other people and what they can do and what they can say to each other. That was the whole idea: two people getting acquainted. And then when you saw it and you saw the sheer simplicity of it, you learned what it was all about. Those movies showed you how some people act and react with other people. They were like actual sociological 'For instance's. They were like documentaries, and if you thought it could apply to you, it was an example, and if it didn't apply to you, at least it was a documentary, it could apply to somebody you knew and it could clear up some questions you had about them. Ch. 3: Senility.\nI've never met a person I couldn't call a beauty. Ch. 4: Beauty.\nI really don't care that much about \"Beauties.\" What I really like are Talkers. To me, good talkers are beautiful because good talk is what I love. The word itself shows why I like Talkers better than Beauties, why I tape more than I film. It's not \"talkies.\" Talkers are doing something. Beauties are being something. Which isn't necessarily bad, it's just that I don't know what it is they're being. It's more fun to be with people who are doing things. Ch. 4: Beauty.\nWhen you're interested in somebody, and you think they might be interested in you, you should point out all your beauty problems and defects right away, rather than take a chance they won't notice them..  .On the other hand, say you have a purely temporary beauty problem—a new pimple, lackluster hair, no-sleep eyes, five extra pounds around the middle. Still, whatever it is, you should point it out..  .If you don't point out these things they might think that your temporary beauty problem is a permanent beauty problem..  .If they really do like you for yourself, they'll be willing to use their imagination to think of what you must look like without your temporary beauty problem. Ch. 4: Beauty.\nIn some circles where very heavy people think they have very heavy brains, words like \"charming\" and \"clever\" and \"pretty\" are all put-downs; all the lighter things in life, which are the most important things, are put down. Ch. 4: Beauty.\nI know a girl who just looks at her face in the medicine cabinet mirror and never looks below her shoulders, and she's four or five hundred pounds but she doesn't see all that, she just sees a beautiful face and therefore she thinks she's a beauty. And therefore, I think she's a beauty, too, because I usually accept people on the basis of their self-images, because their self-images have more to do with the way they think than their objective-images do. Ch. 4: Beauty.\nThe most beautiful thing in Tokyo is McDonald's. The most beautiful thing in Stockholm is McDonald's. The most beautiful thing in Florence is McDonald's. Peking and Moscow don't have anything beautiful yet. Ch. 4: Beauty.\nI'm confused about who the news belongs to. I always have it in my head that if your name's in the news, then the news should be paying you. Because it's your news and they're taking it and selling it as their product. But then they always say that they're helping you, and that's true too, but still, if people didn't give the news their news, and if everybody kept their news to themselves, the news wouldn't have any news. So I guess you should pay each other. But I haven't figured it out fully yet. Ch. 5: Fame.\nBefore I was shot [June, 1968], I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there - I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in the movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen to you in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television - you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television. Ch. 6: Work.\nI suppose I have a really loose interpretation of \"work\" because I think that just being alive is so much work at something you don't always want to do. Being born is like being kidnapped. And then sold into slavery. People are working every minute. The machinery is always going. Even when you sleep. Ch. 6: Work.\nAfter being alive, the next hardest work is having sex. Of course, for some people it isn't work because they need the exercise and they've got the energy for the sex and the sex gives them even more energy. Some people get energy from sex and some people lose energy from sex. I have found that it's too much work. But if you have the time for it, and if you need that exercise—then you should do it. But you could really save yourself a lot of trouble either way by first figuring out whether you're an energy-getter or an energy-loser. As I said, I'm an energy-loser. But I can understand it when I see people running around trying to get some. Ch. 6: Work.\nI thought that young people had more problems than old people, and I hoped I could last until I was older so I wouldn't have all those problems. Then I looked around and saw that everybody who looked young had young problems and that everybody who looked old had old problems. The \"old\" problems to me looked easier to take than the \"young\" problems. So I decided to go gray so nobody would know now old I was and I would look younger to them than how old they thought I was. I would gain a lot by going gray: (1) I would have old problems, which were easier to take than young problems, (2) everyone would be impressed by how young I looked, and (3) I would be relieved of the responsibility of acting young—I could occasionally lapse into eccentricity or senility and no one would think anything of it because of my gray hair. When you've got gray hair, every move you make seems \"young\" and \"spry,\" instead of just being normally active. It's like you're getting a new talent. So I dyed my hair gray when I was about twenty-three or twenty-four. Ch. 6: Work.\nThe President has so much good publicity potential that hasn't been exploited. He should just sit down one day and make a list of all the things that people are embarrassed to do that they shouldn't be embarrassed to do, and then do them all on television. Ch. 6: Work.\nWhat's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it. Ch. 6: Work.\nSometimes you fantasize that people who are really up-there and rich and living it up have something you don't have, that their things must be better than your things because they have more money than you. But they drink the same Cokes and eat the same hot dogs and wear the same ILGWU clothes and see the same TV shows and the same movies. Rich people can't see a sillier version of w:Truth or Consequences , or a scarier version of w:The Exorcist . You can get just as revolted as they can—you can have the same nightmares. All of this is really American. Ch. 6: Work.\nSometimes you're invited to a big ball and for months you think about how glamorous and exciting it's going to be. Then you fly to Europe and you go to the ball and when you think back on it a couple of months later what you remember is maybe the car ride to the ball, you can't remember the ball at all. Sometimes the little times you don't think are anything while they're happening turn out to be what marks a whole period of your life. I should have been dreaming for months about the car ride to the ball and getting dressed for the car ride, and buying my ticket to Europe so I could take the car ride. Then, who knows, maybe I could have remembered the ball. Ch. 7: Time.\nThey always say that time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself. Ch. 7: Time.\nSometimes people let the same problem make them miserable for years when they could just say, \"So what.\" That's one of my favorite things to say. \"So what.\" \"My mother didn't love me.\" So what. \"My husband won't ball me.\" So what. \"I'm a success but I'm still alone.\" So what. I don't know how I made it through all the years before I learned how to do that trick. It took a long time for me to learn it, but once you do, you never forget. Ch. 7: Time.\nI really do live for the future, because when I'm eating a box of candy, I can't wait to taste the last piece. I don't even taste any of the other pieces, I just want to finish and throw the box away and not have to have it on my mind any more. I would rather either have it now or know I'll never have it so I don't have to think about it. That's why some days I wish I were very very old-looking so I wouldn't have to think about getting old-looking. Ch. 7: Time.\nI don't believe in it, because you're not around to know that it's happened. I can't say anything about it because I'm not prepared for it. Ch. 8: Death.\nI really believe in empty spaces, although, as an artist, I make a lot of junk. Empty space is never-wasted space. Wasted space is any space that has art in it. An artist is somebody who produces things that people don't need to have but that he, for some reason, thinks it would be a good idea to give them. Ch. 10: Atmosphere.\nWhen I look at things, I always see the space they occupy. I always want the space to reappear, to make a comeback, because it's lost space when there's something in it. If I see a chair in a beautiful space, no matter how beautiful the chair is, it can never be as beautiful to me as the plain space. Ch. 10: Atmosphere.\nFree countries are great, because you can actually sit in somebody else's space for a while and pretend you're a part of it. You can sit in the Plaza Hotel and you don't even have to live there. You can just sit and watch the people go by. Ch. 10: Atmosphere.\nSomebody said that Bertolt Brecht [German socialist writer of political theater] wanted everybody to think alike. I want everybody to think alike. But Brecht wanted to do it through Communism, in a way. Russia is doing it under government. It's happening here [in America] all by itself without being under a strict government; so if it's working without trying, why can't it work without being Communist? Everybody looks alike and acts alike, and we're getting more and more that way. p. 26.\nBusiness art is the step that comes after Art. I started as a commercial artist, and I want to finish as a business artist. After I did the thing called 'art' or whatever it's called, I went into business art. I wanted to be an Art Businessman or a Business Artist. Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. During the hippies era people put down the idea of business – they'd say 'Money is bad', and 'Working is bad', but making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art. p. 92.\nWhen I have to think about it, I know the picture is wrong. And sizing is a form of thinking and coloring is too. My instinct about painting says, 'If you don’t think about it, it's right'. As soon as you have to decide and choose, it's wrong. And the more you decide about, the more wrong it gets. Some people, they paint abstract, so they sit there thinking about it because their thinking makes them feel they're doing something. But my thinking never makes me feel I'm doing anything. p. 149.\n1980s[edit] A lot of people thought it was me everyone at the 'Factory' was hanging around, that I was some kind of big attraction that everyone came to see, but that's absolutely backward: it was me who was hanging around everyone else. I just paid the rent, and the crowds came simply because the door was open. People weren't particularly interested in seeing me; they were interested in seeing each other. They came to see who came.

Andy Warhol: Uh, no, I like them in closets.\n Edward Smith: Why is it more of a pleasure to do 30 or 40 pictures than to do just one? Andy Warhol: Then I can, uh, listen to my soundabout which looks just like the thing that I'm wearing now, and you can listen to opera and stuff like that. Edward Smith: Does that mean you don't have to think when you're painting? Andy Warhol: No, you can listen to really good music. Edward Smith: So, what, painting is an excuse to listen to really good music? Andy Warhol: Oh, yeah.\n Edward Smith: What do you think is the characteristic of a really nice person? Some people you obviously do like more than others. Andy Warhol: Ummm, well, if they talk a lot. Edward Smith: What, and don't make you talk? Andy Warhol: Yeah, yes, that's a really nice person. Edward Smith: Thank you, Andy.\n I still care about people but it would be so much easier not to care. I don't want to get to close: I don't like to touch things, that's why my work is so distant from myself [Nicolas Love, April 1987] In: Warhol in his own words – Untitled Statements ( 1963 – 1987) , selected by Neil Printz, in Andy Warhol, retrospective , Art and Bullfinch Press / Little Brown, 1989, pp. 457 – 467.\nundated quotes[edit] Sex is nostalgia for sex. Quote from: [1].\nApparently, most people love watching the same basic thing [actions shows on TV], as long as the details are different. But I'm just the opposite: if I'm going to sit and watch the same thing I saw the night before, I don't want it to be essentially the same – I want it to be exactly the same. Because the more you look at the same exact thing, the more the meaning goes away, and the better and emptier you feel. (1960's) In: Warhol in his own words – Untitled Statements ( 1963 – 1987) , selected by Neil Printz; as quoted in Andy Warhol, retrospective , Art and Bullfinch Press / Little Brown, 1989, pp. 457 – 467.\nIn my art work, hand painting would take much too long and anyway that's not the age we're living in. In: Machine in the Studio , Caroline A. Jones, University of Chicago Press, 1996 pp. 197-198.\nI think somebody should be able to do all my paintings for me. As quoted in Pop Art, an Critical History , Steven Henry Madoff, Madoff, University of California Press, Berkeley 1997, p. 104.\nQuotes about Andy Warhol[edit] Warhol's art can both subvert (up to a point) formal art and, at the same time, offer socially provocative documents to the ordinary, white, middle-class citizen. Blacks and the poor do not like Warhol's art or movies. Documents that are mainly intended as deliberate references to a predominant white culture cannot incite the imaginations of those who don't give a fuck for that culture in the first place, even if they did understand what it was all about. This inability of Warhol to reach blacks and the poor represents the weakest aspect of his art. Warhol's art implies a certain disgust on the part of the artist for culture — a disgust he shares in common with New Left revolutionaries and progressive activist artists and critics. His latest decision, to stop painting altogether, is a deliberate step in the direction away from culture itself. It is also an inevitable step, as the very notion of art works that possess a quality as items to be traded upon the New York art exchange is incompatible with the socialization of art. Modern culture is a repressive, police agency. The police function of modern culture has been recognized by Warhol. His paintings of electric chairs, police attacks, most-wanted men, and car crashes all seem to reflect in art the reality of an official culture of repression rather than of life. Gregory Battcock (1970), in: Art and Artists, Vol. 5, p. 13.\nI think he [Andy Warhol] would be very interested in the moment that the w:Dalai Lama appears, being involved in such a kind of idea. Andy has always difficulties with this kind of political activities, because he works in another kind of world, but he is always..  .Also when he was here (in Germany) last week, he is very interested to hear a lot of new information. He has a kind of observing sense in the back of his mind. So, he is always interested to follow the development, and there is really a kind of imaginative process going on, I think. Joseph Beuys (1981), in Joseph Beuys and the Dalai Lama; Interview with Louwrien Wijers in: Kuoni (n.5), pp. 189; Republished in: Joseph Beuys, Carin Kuoni. Joseph Beuys in America: Energy Plan for the Western Man. New York, 1993.\nI'll give you an interesting analogy here. Have you ever read w:Carson McCullers ' w:The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter ? All right. Now in that book you'll remember that this deaf mute, Mr. Singer, this person who doesn't communicate at all, is finally revealed in a subtle way to be a completely empty, heartless person. And yet because he's a deaf mute, he symbolizes things to desperate people. They come to him and tell him all their troubles. They cling to him as a source of strength, as a kind of semi-religious figure in their lives. Andy is kind of like Mr. Singer. Desperate, lost people find their way to him, looking for some sort of salvation, and Andy sort of sits back like a deaf mute with very little to offer. Truman Capote (1982), as quoted in Edie: An American Biography , Jean Stein and w:George Plimpton.\nHe was a slight man who wore a white wig. The Times, Obituary, February 1987.\n This Neo-Dada , which they call New Realism , Pop Art , Assemblage etc. [Duchamp is referring to Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein ,] is an easy way out and lives on what Dada did. When I discovered ready-mades I thought to discourage aesthetics. In Neo-Dada they have taken my ready-made's and found aesthetic beauty in them. I threw the bottle-rack and the urinal in their faces as a challenge and now they admire them for their aesthetic beauty. Marcel Duchamp (1962), in his letter to the German artist w:Hans Richter ; as quoted in Hans Richter, Dada Art and Anti-Art - New York: McGraw-Hill, 1965, pp. 207-8.\nNo director in human history has ever made or will ever make worse movies. Warhol makes Ed Wood look like Ingmar Bergman . Dana Gioia (October 2002), \"Glass Appeal: Philip Glass's Film Scores,\" San Francisco Magazine.\nIn a strange way, Andy attracted attention because of his wig and his blank personality, which were both really disguises. I saw him at a party once at the Sculls' in Great Neck. He was quiet, polite, and odd, but without any of the posing that he later affected. He was a very single-minded person; he had this drive to work, work, work. James Rosenquist , Painting Below Zero: Notes on a Life in Art , Alfred A. Knopf, 2009 p. 128.\nExternal links[edit] Wikipedia has an article about: Andy Warhol.\nWikimedia Commons has media related to: Andy Warhol.\nWarhol Foundation in New York, New York.\n Warhol at NNDB

{"id": 287, "data": "Anri Sala Anri Sala was born in 1974 in Tirana, Albania, where he studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts at the beginning of the 1990s. He then continued his training at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and Le Fresnoy, and Studio National des Arts Contemporains, Tourcoing, France. While there, he turned his attention to video. He currently lives and works in Berlin. Using different media, ranging from video clips to documentaries, Sala bases his work on real details that he poetically transforms to reveal unusual aspects of the present. Adopting the point of view of minor characters, his videos deal with the great themes of life and transform small stories into universal tales. His works tend towards discreet recordings of secret or marginal realities to which the moving images gives a fragile existence, which is both documentary and magical. In the 1990s Dala was interested in portraying Albania following the Communist régime, but since 2000 his interest has moved to the study of sound and music in relation to images and architecture. In 2013 Anri Sala represented France at the 55th Venice Biennale. The most important exhibitions dedicated to his work include those at Haus der Kunst, Munich (2014), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (2012) and Serpentine Gallery, London (2011). His work was included in the exhibition ‘Voice of Images’ (2012-13) at Palazzo Grassi and included in the exhibition 'Luogo e Segni' (2019) at Punta della Dogana.\n", "label": [[0, 9, "ARTIST"], [10, 19, "ARTIST"], [32, 36, "DATE"], [40, 55, "GPE"], [135, 140, "DATE"], [230, 235, "GPE"], [296, 313, "GPE"], [394, 400, "GPE"], [468, 472, "ARTIST"], [895, 900, "DATE"], [935, 942, "GPE"], [985, 989, "DATE"], [1088, 1092, "DATE"], [1093, 1102, "ARTIST"], [1115, 1121, "GPE"], [1129, 1149, "EVENT"], [1221, 1235, "MUSEUM"], [1237, 1243, "GPE"], [1245, 1249, "DATE"], [1252, 1275, "MUSEUM"], [1277, 1282, "GPE"], [1284, 1288, "DATE"], [1294, 1312, "GALLERY"], [1314, 1320, "GPE"], [1322, 1326, "DATE"], [1370, 1385, "EVENT"], [1388, 1395, "DATE"], [1400, 1414, "MUSEUM"], [1447, 1460, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1463, 1467, "DATE"], [1472, 1490, "MUSEUM"]]}
